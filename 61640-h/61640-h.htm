<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>There are few books which treat of the history
of education, and fewer which attempt to show the
part that the educational work has ever borne in
the upbuilding of nations. That religion is inseparably
connected with, and upheld by, the system
of education maintained by its advocates, has been
recognized by many historians in a casual way;
but, to the author’s knowledge, no one has
hitherto made this thought the subject of a
volume.</p>

<p>In teaching the history of education and the
growth of Protestantism, the close relationship
ever existing between the latter and true methods
of education led to a careful study of the educational
system of the nations of the earth, especially
of those nations which have exerted a
lasting influence upon the world’s history. The
present volume is the result of that study.</p>

<p>D’Aubigné says that in the Reformation “the
school was early placed beside the church; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
these two great institutions, so powerful to regenerate
the nations, were equally reanimated by it.
It was by a close alliance with learning that the
Reformation entered into the world.”</p>

<p>True education, Protestantism, and republicanism
form a threefold union which defies the
powers of earth to overthrow; but to-day the
Protestant churches are growing weak, and the
boasted freedom of America’s democracy is being
exchanged for monarchical principles of government.</p>

<p>This weakness is rightly attributed by some to
the want of proper education. The same cause
of degeneracy would doubtless be assigned by
many others, were effects traced to their source.</p>

<p>The author has attempted, by a generous use
of historical quotations, to so arrange facts that
the reader will see that the hope of Protestantism
and the hope of republicanism lies in
the proper education of the youth; and that this
true education is found in the principles delivered
by Jehovah to his chosen people, the Jews;
that it was afterward more fully demonstrated by
the Master Teacher, Christ; that the Reformation
witnessed a revival of these principles; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Protestants to-day, if true to their faith, will educate
their children in accordance with these same
principles.</p>

<p>Due credit is given to the authors quoted, a
list of whose names appears at the end of the
volume. A complete index renders this work
easy of reference.</p>

<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY: GOD THE SOURCE OF WISDOM</span></h2>

<p>“Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a
place for gold where they fine it. Iron is taken
out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
stone.... As for the earth, out of it cometh
bread; and under it is turned up as it were fire.
The stones of it are the place of sapphires; and
it hath dust of gold. There is a path which no
fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath
not seen. The lion’s whelps have not trodden
it, nor the fierce lion passed by it....</p>

<p>“<i>But where shall wisdom be found?</i> And
<i>where is the place of understanding?</i> Man knoweth
not the price thereof; neither is it found in
the land of the living. The depth saith, It is not
in me; and the sea saith, It is not with me. <i>It
can not be gotten for gold</i>, neither shall silver
be weighed for the price thereof.... The gold
and the crystal can not equal it; and the exchange
of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
<i>Whence then cometh wisdom?</i> And where is the
place of understanding?... <i>God understandeth
the way thereof, and He knoweth the place
thereof.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Man sometimes feels that <i>he</i> understands the
way of wisdom, and boasts that he <i>knows</i> the
place thereof. He may indeed understand it
in a measure, and he may ascertain its abiding
place; but that knowledge comes in one way,
and only one. He who understandeth the way
thereof and knoweth the place thereof, opens a
channel which connects earth with that fountain
of life.</p>

<p>In the creation of the universe that wisdom
was manifested. “When He made a decree for
the <i>rain</i>, and a way for the <i>lightning of the
thunder</i>; then did He see it, and declare it; He
prepared it, yea, and searched it out.” Written
on the face of creation is the <span class="smcap">wisdom of the
eternal</span>. “And unto man He said, Behold, the
fear of the Lord, <span class="smcap">that is wisdom</span>; and to depart
from evil is understanding.” In other words,
when man lives in harmony with God,—that is,
when physically he acts in accordance with the
laws of the universe; when mentally his thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
are those of the Father; and when spiritually
his soul responds to the drawing power of love,
that power which controls creation,—then has
he entered the royal road which leads direct to
<span class="smcap">wisdom</span>.</p>

<p>Where is the wise? There is implanted in
each human heart a longing to come in touch
with wisdom. God, by the abundance of life, is
as a great magnet, drawing humanity to Himself.
So close is the union that in Christ are
hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
In one man—a man made of flesh and
blood like all men now living—there dwelt the
spirit of wisdom. More than this, in Him are
“hid all the treasures of wisdom;” and hence
the life of Immanuel stands a constant witness
that the <span class="smcap">wisdom of the ages</span> is accessible to
man. And the record adds, “Ye are complete
in Him.”</p>

<p>This wisdom brings eternal life; for in Him are
“hid all the treasures of wisdom,” “and ye are
complete in Him.” “This is life eternal, that
they might know Thee the only true God.”</p>

<p>Christ, at Jacob’s well, explained to the woman
of Samaria, and through her to you and me, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
means of gaining wisdom. The well of living
water, from the depths of which the patriarch had
drawn for himself, his children, and his cattle,
and which he bequeathed as a rich legacy to generations
following, who drank, and blessed his
name, symbolized worldly wisdom. Men to-day
mistake this for that wisdom described in Job, of
which God understandeth the way and knoweth
the place. Christ spoke of this latter when He
said, “If thou knewest the gift of God, and who
it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
wouldst have asked of Him, and He would have
given thee <i>living water</i>.” “If any man thirst,
let him come unto Me, and drink.”</p>

<p>Why, then, if wisdom may be had for the asking,
if that spiritual drink may be had for the taking,
are not all filled? The fountain flows free; why
are not all satisfied? Only one reason can be
given: men in their search accept falsehood in
place of truth. This blunts their sensibilities, until
the false seems true and the true false.</p>

<p>“Where is the wise?... hath not God made
foolish the wisdom of this world?” “Howbeit we
speak wisdom among the perfect (full-grown): yet
a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
this age which are coming to naught: but we
speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom
that hath been hidden, ... which none
of the rulers of this world knoweth.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>There is, then, a distinction between the wisdom
of God and that of this world. How, then, can
we attain unto the higher life,—to the real, the
true wisdom? There are things which eye hath
not seen nor ear heard, which eyes should see
and ears hear, and these “God hath revealed
unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth
all things, yea, the deep things of God.”</p>

<p>To man, then, if born of the Spirit, is given a
spiritual eyesight which pierces infinitude, and
enables the soul to commune with the Author of
all things. No wonder the realization of such
possibilities within himself led the psalmist to
exclaim, “Such knowledge is too wonderful for
me; it is high, I can not attain unto it.” And
Paul himself exclaimed, “O the depth of the
riches both of the <i>wisdom</i> and <i>knowledge</i> of God!...
For who hath known the mind of the
Lord?” “The things of God knoweth no man,
but the Spirit of God.” And “we have received,
not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of God; that we might know the things that are
freely given to us of God.” Hence to us <i>is</i> given
the power to commune with Him and to search
into the mysteries of the otherwise unfathomable.</p>

<p>Dealing with wisdom is education. If it be the
wisdom of the world, then it is <i>worldly education</i>;
if, on the other hand, it is a search for the wisdom
of God, it is <span class="smcap">Christian Education</span>.</p>

<p>Over these two questions the controversy between
good and evil is waging. The final triumph
of truth will place the advocates of Christian education
in the kingdom of God. “God is a Spirit:
and they that worship Him must worship in spirit
and in truth.”</p>

<p>That education which links man with God, the
source of wisdom, and the author and finisher of
our faith, is a spiritual education, and prepares the
heart for that kingdom which is within.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HEAVENLY SCHOOL</span></h2>

<p>God’s throne, the center around which circled
the worlds which had gone forth from the hand
of the Creator, was the school of the universe.
The Upholder of the worlds was Himself the great
Teacher, and His character, love, was the theme of
contemplation. Every lesson was a manifestation
of His power. To illustrate the workings of the
laws of His nature, this Teacher had but to speak,
and before the attentive multitudes there stood
the living thing. “He spake, and it was; He
commanded, and it stood fast.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Angels, and the beings of other worlds in countless
numbers, were the students. The course was
to extend through eternity; observations were carried
on through limitless space, and included everything
from the smallest to the mightiest force,
from the formation of the dewdrop to the building
of the worlds, and the growth of the mind. To
finish the course, if such an expression is permissible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
meant to reach the perfection of the
Creator Himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Angel
teachers</div>

<p>To the angelic host was given a work.
The inhabitants of worlds were on probation.
It was the joy of angels to
minister to and teach other creatures of the universe.
The law of love was everywhere written;
it was the constant study of the heavenly
beings. Each thought of God was taken by
them; and as they saw the workings of His plans,
they fell before the King of kings, crying,
“Holy, holy, holy.” Eternity was all too short
to reveal His love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lucifer’s
place in
the school
of Christ</div>

<p>The Father and Son were often in
council. Wrapped together in that
glory, the universe awaited the expression
of Their one will. As one of the
covering cherubim, Lucifer stood the first in power
and majesty of all the angelic host. His eye
beheld, his ear heard, he knew of all except the
deep counsels which the Father, from all eternity,
had purposed in the Son. “Christ the Word,
the only begotten of God, was one with the
eternal Father,—one in nature, in character, in
purpose,—the only being that could enter into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
all the counsels and purposes of God.... The
Father wrought by His Son in the creation of
all heavenly beings. ‘By Him were all things
created, ... whether they be thrones, or dominions,
or principalities, or powers. All things were
created by Him, and for Him.’ Angels are God’s
ministers, radiant with the light ever flowing from
His presence, and speeding on rapid wing to
execute His will. But the Son, the anointed of
God, the ‘express image of His person,’ the
‘brightness of his glory,’ ‘upholding all things by
the word of His power,’ holds supremacy over
them all.” Lucifer, “son of the morning,” who
“sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect
in beauty, ... every precious stone was
thy covering.” “Thou art the anointed cherub
that covereth; I have set thee so; thou wast upon
the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up
and down in the midst of the stones of fire.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
He who had hovered over the throne of God,
who had stood on the mount of the congregation
in the sides of the north, and walked up and
down among those living stones, each flashing
with electric brightness the glory of reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
light, looked upon the council, and envied the
position of the Son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason
takes the
place of
faith</div>

<p>Hitherto all eyes had turned instinctively
toward the center of light. A
cloud, the first one known, darkened
the glory of the covering cherub.
Turning his eyes inward, he reasoned that he
was wronged. Had not he, Lucifer, been the
bearer of light and joy to worlds beyond? Why
should not his might be recognized? “Thou wast
perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
created till iniquity was found in thee.” “Thine
heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou
hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy
brightness.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “Thou hast said in thine heart, I
will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne
above the stars of God: <i>I</i> will sit also upon
the mount of the congregation, in the sides of
the north: I will ascend above the heights of
the clouds: I will be like the Most High.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
true
Teacher</div>

<p>While Lucifer thus reasoned, Christ,
wrapped within the glory of the Father,
was offering His life for the world at
its creation. Sin had not yet entered,
the world was not yet created; but as the plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were laid, the Son had said, “Should sin enter,
I am, from this time, one with those We now
create, and their fall will mean My life on earth.
Never has My heart gone out for any creation as
I put it into this. Man in his earthly home
shall have the highest expression of Our love,
and for him My love demands that I lay My
life beside his in his very creation.” O wondrous
gift! O unselfish love! How could that
covering cherub, at the moment when the Son
of God laid down His life, plan on his own exaltation?
Sorrow, the first sorrow that was ever
known, filled heaven. The angel choir was silent;
the living stones withheld their shining. The
stillness was felt throughout the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation
chooses
teachers</div>

<p>An offer was made to return, but pride
now closed the channel. Pity and
admiration for the leader of the hosts
led many to feel that God was unjustly severe.
The universe was on trial. “Satan and his
sympathizers were striving to reform the government
of God. They wished to look into His
unsearchable wisdom, and ascertain His purpose
in exalting Jesus, and endowing Him with such
unlimited power and command.” Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
before, inspired by love, took God at His word,
and found their highest pleasure in watching the
revealings of His love, now put their own minds
in place of God’s word, and reasoned that all
was wrong. The unfoldings of His love, which
had meant their very life, now looked but darkness
and despair. God’s wisdom, darkened by
placing self between the throne and them,
became foolishness. “All the heavenly host
were summoned to appear before the Father to
have each case decided.” “About the throne
gathered the holy angels, a vast, unnumbered
throng,—‘ten thousand times ten thousand, and
thousands of thousands,’—the most exalted angels,
as ministers and subjects, rejoicing in the light
that fell upon them from the presence of the
Deity.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of
the rival
system of
education</div>

<p>The principles of God’s government
were now laid bare: it was nothing but
a great, broad system of educational
development, and angelic hosts then
and there decided whether faith in His word
would be the standard of their obedience, or
whether finite reason would bear sway. Even
Satan himself was almost won, as the notes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
praise resounded through the domes of heaven;
but again pride ruled. Here was born the rival
system,—supreme selfishness facing the utter self-forgetfulness
of Christ, reason over against faith.
After long pleadings, and amidst deep mourning,
heaven’s portals opened to close forever upon
the one who, with his followers, turned from
light into the darkness of despair.</p>

<p>A new era was ushered in; a controversy was
begun. High heaven, with its eternal principles of
love, life, progress, was challenged by a subtle foe,
the father of lies. Deep as is the misery attending
the step, yet coexistent with the downward
move was formulated the plan which, after the
lapse of ages, will prove in a greater degree,
and manifest eternally the truth, that “<span class="smcap">God is
love</span>.” The pathway is the way of the cross.
It is a retracing of the mental degradation occasioned
by the fall, but the process is according
to the law of the school of heaven,—“according
to your faith.” If ye believe, all things are
possible.</p>

<h2 id="III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EDENIC SCHOOL</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Creation</div>

<p>“He spake, and it was; He commanded,
and it stood fast.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Forth from the
throne of the Infinite passed the decree, and life
flashing out into space, a world stood forth.
Myriads of other worlds, held in their orbits by
the ceaseless power of love, made their circuit
about the throne of God. But one space in the
universe had been reserved for the highest expression
of His love, where was to be manifested the
depths of this divine attribute. “And the earth
was waste and void; and darkness was upon the
face of the deep.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But even into the darkness
His presence penetrated; and as “the Spirit of
God was brooding upon the waters,” He said,
“Let there be light,” and darkness scattered before
the word. The light, reflective of His own
being, pleased Him; and He willed that it should
be ever present, accompanying every form of life.
The first day’s work was done,—a day such as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
future man would know, and which, even in his
fallen state, would measure off his years.</p>

<p>The second day heard the mandate for the
water to separate; and a third gathered the waters
into seas, with the dry land appearing. And then
“God said, Let the earth put forth grass,”—the
lowly blade covering the earth’s nakedness with a
robe of living green, itself so humble, yet a part
of His life; for his life-breath formed it, and it
partook of that life. Then came the herbs and
lofty trees, each bearing seed,—self-productive,—for
<i>life is</i> reproductive; and as the living coal
kindles a sacred fire, so each tree bore within itself
the power to reproduce its kind. “And God saw
that it was good.” Then, that His own light
might ever be the cause of growth, He placed
luminaries in the heavens, each being the reflection
of His own countenance. By this should life
be sustained.</p>

<p>Into the moving waters passed the power of
life. “God said, Let the waters swarm with
swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above
the earth in the open firmament of heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
At His word an abundance of life filled earth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sky and sea. Every drop of water sustained life;
every square inch of air supported its myriads.
And from the mighty leviathan that sported in
the waters to the mote that floated in the air, all
life proclaimed the love of God; and the Creator,
viewing with satisfaction the work of His hand,
pronounced each form of life perfect in its sphere.
Each held within its own body the breath of life;
each in its every movement sang hallelujahs to
the Maker of the heavens and the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mind—the
highest
form
of creation</div>

<p>But the work was not yet complete.
A mind controlled the universe; and its
powers could be appreciated, its heart-love
returned in the fullest sense, only
by mind,—by beings made in the image
of God Himself. And so “God said, Let Us
make man in Our image, after Our likeness.”
He can then hold dominion over the lower
orders of creation, and standing to them as We
do to the universe, all nature will see Our power
in him. “So God created man in His own
image, in the image of God created He him;
male and female created He them.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>As if the moment of supreme endeavor had
been reached even by God, He molded the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of clay,—one, only one, in the image of Himself.
He breathed into its nostrils His own
breath,—that breath which, vocalized, moved the
worlds; before which angels bowed in adoration.
That all-pervading element of life surged through
the mighty frame, the organs performed their
functions, the brain worked; the man Adam
stood forth, strong and perfect; and instead of
the piercing wail which now announces the beginning
of a new life, his lips parted, and a song
of praise ascended to the Creator.</p>

<p>Standing by his side was his Elder Brother,
Christ, the King of heaven. Adam felt the thrill
of unity and harmony; and while for a “little
time inferior,” yet within him lay the possibilities
of attaining greater heights than angels held. He
was to be the companion of God, the perfect
reflection of His light and glory; there was no
thought of God that might not have access to
the brain of man. The universe spread out
in panoramic view before him. The earth, newborn,
presented untold beauties. By his side
stood his companion, the other half of his own
nature, the two forming a perfect whole. The
harmony of thought brought strength and life;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and, as a result of this unity, new beings like
themselves would be brought into existence, until
the earth was peopled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Eden
home</div>

<p>God planted a garden eastward in
Eden, and from the beauties of the
earth chose the most beautiful spot for
the home of the new pair. In the midst of
the garden stood the tree of life, the fruit of
which afforded man a perfect physical food.
Beneath its spreading branches God Himself
visited them, and, talking with them face to
face, revealed to them the way of immortality.
As they ate of the fruit of the tree of life,
and found every physical want supplied, they
were constantly reminded of the need of the
spiritual meat which was gained by open converse
with the Light from heaven. The glory
of God surrounded the tree, and enwrapped in
this halo, Adam and Eve spent much time in
communing with the heavenly visitors. According
to the divine system of teaching, they were
here to study the laws of God and learn of
his character. They “were not only His children,
but students receiving instruction from the all-wise
Creator.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Subjects
taught in
the first
school on
earth</div>

<p>Angels, beholding the wonders of the
new creation, delighted to fly earthward;
and two from the heavenly host,
by special appointment, became the
instructors of the holy ones. “They
were full of vigor imparted by the tree of life,
and their intellectual power was but little less
than that of the angels. The mysteries of the
visible universe—‘the wondrous works of Him
who is perfect in knowledge,’—afforded them an
exhaustless source of instruction and delight.
The laws and operations of nature, which have
engaged men’s study for six thousand years,
were opened to their minds by the infinite
Framer and Upholder of the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">a. Botany
b. Zoology

e. Meteorology
f. Mineralogy</div>

<p>“They held converse with leaf and
flower and tree, gathering from each
the secrets of its life. With every living
creature, from the mighty leviathan
that playeth among the waters to the
insect mote that floats in the sunbeam,
Adam was familiar. He had given to
each its name, and he was acquainted
with the nature and habits of all.
God’s glory in the heavens, the innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
worlds in their orderly revolutions, ‘the balancing
of the clouds,’ the mysteries of light and sound,
of day and night,—all were open to the study of
our first parents. On every leaf of the forest
or stone of the mountains, in every shining star,
in earth and air and sky, God’s name was written.
The order and harmony of creation spoke
to them of infinite wisdom and power. They
were ever discovering some attraction that filled
their hearts with deeper love, and called forth
fresh expressions of gratitude.”</p>

<p>As new beauties came to their attention, they
were filled with wonder. Each visit of the heavenly
teachers elicited from the earthly students
scores of questions which it was the delight of
the angels to answer; and they in turn opened
to the minds of Adam and Eve principles of
living truth which sent them forth to their daily
tasks of pleasure full of wondering curiosity, ready
to use every God-given sense to discover illustrations
of the wisdom of heaven. “As long as
they remained loyal to the divine law, their
capacity to know, to enjoy, and to love would
continually increase. They would be constantly
gaining new treasures of knowledge, discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fresh springs of happiness, and obtaining clearer
and yet clearer conceptions of the immeasurable,
unfailing love of God.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Method of
instruction</div>

<p>The divine method of teaching is here
revealed,—God’s way of dealing with
minds which are loyal to him. The
governing laws of the universe were
expounded. Man, as if looking into a picture,
found in earth, sky, and sea, in the animate and
inanimate world, the exemplification of those
laws. He believed, and with a heavenly light,
which is the reward of faith, he approached each
new subject of investigation. Divine truths unfolded
continually. Life, power, happiness,—these
subjects grew with his growth. The angels
stimulated the desire to question, and again led
their students to search for answers to their own
questions. At his work of dressing the garden,
Adam learned truths which only work could
reveal. As the tree of life gave food to the
flesh, and reminded constantly of the mental
and spiritual food necessary, so manual training
added light to the mental discipline. The laws
of the physical, mental, and spiritual world were
enunciated; man’s threefold nature received attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
This was education, perfect and complete.</p>

<p>The magnetic power about the tree of life
held man, filling his senses with a thrill of
delight. Adam and Eve lived by that power,
and the human mind was an open channel for
the flow of God’s thought. Rapidly the character
of the Edenic pair was being formed, but
strength could not come from mere automatic
action. Freedom to choose God’s company and
spirit was given; and while He wooed them with
His tenderest love, He had placed in the midst
of the garden a tree of another sort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A lesson
in faith</div>

<p>To the man He said, “Of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
not eat of it; for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> What was
the meaning of this command? As the angel
teachers heard the question from man’s lips, a
cloud seemed to dim the brightness of their glory.
Did not Adam feel a strange sensation, as if the
fullness of divine thought was suddenly checked in
its course through his brain? He was preparing
himself to accept teachings of a different character.
Then was told the story of the one sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
heaven had known,—of the fall of Lucifer, and the
darkness it brought to him; that while he lived, the
decree of God was that he could no longer remain
within the walls of Paradise. In low tones it was
told how some could not see the justice of this;
that Lucifer had been given the earth as his present
home; that he would use his arts to capture
them; but that light and power had been placed
about the tree of life, and remaining true to the
teaching given within the circle of its rays, no evil
could overtake them. “Faith, have faith in
God’s word,” said the angel, as he winged his
flight toward heaven.</p>

<p>The word “death” sounded unnatural to human
ears, and as they sat together talking of the
angel’s words, a longing to understand filled their
hearts. Fear?—they knew no such word. Was
not their Maker <i>love</i>? Eve, wandering from her
husband’s side, found, before she knew it, that she
was nearing the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil. She stood gazing from a distance, when
from the rich verdure came a voice of sweetest
music:—</p>

<p>“Beautiful woman, made in God’s own image,
what can mar thy perfect beauty? What can stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that life now coursing through thy veins? ‘Hath
God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?...
Ye shall not surely die: for God doth
know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods knowing
good and evil.’” Speaking, he plucked and
ate. Was this the deceiver? Had she not been
promised a knowledge of all things? Was she not
to be with God? Perhaps this was some new revelation
of his goodness. She felt no danger. He
ate, why should not she?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
doubt</div>

<p>Her curiosity was aroused, and she was
flattered by the words of the serpent.
Instead of fleeing, she argued with him,
and attempted to decide in her own mind between
right and wrong. But God had told her what was
right. That moment of indecision, of doubting,
was the devil’s opportunity.</p>

<p>Unable to reach the soul of man by direct
means, Satan approached it through those outer
channels, the senses. He had everything to win,
and proceeded cautiously. If man’s <i>mind</i> could
be gained, his great work would be accomplished.
To do this he used a process of reasoning—a
method the reverse of that used by the Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in his instruction at the tree of life. The mind
of Eve was strong, and quickly drew conclusions;
hence, when her new teacher said, “If ye eat, ‘ye
shall be as gods,’” in the mind of Eve arose the
thought, God has immortality. “Therefore,” said
Satan, “if <i>ye</i> eat, ‘ye shall not surely die.’” The
conclusion was logically drawn, and the world, from
the days of Eve to the present time, has based its
religious belief on that syllogism, the major premise
of which, as did Eve, they fail to recognize as
false. Why?—Because they use the mind to
decide the truth instead of taking a direct statement
from the Author of wisdom. From this one
false premise comes the doctrine of the natural
immortality of man, with its endless variations,
some modern names of which are theosophy, Spiritualism,
reincarnation, and evolution. The sons
and daughters of Eve condemn her for the mistake
made six thousand years ago, while they themselves
repeat it without question. It is preached
from the pulpit, it is taught in the schoolroom,
and its spirit pervades the thought of every book
written whose author is not in perfect harmony
with God and truth. Now began the study of
“dialectics,” so destructive to the Christian’s faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Eve was
deceived
because
she depended
upon
sense
perceptions</div>

<p>Having accepted the logic of the
serpent, and having transferred her
faith from the word of God to the tree
of knowledge at Satan’s suggestion, the
woman could easily be led to test
the truth of all his statements by her
senses. A theory had been advanced;
the experimental process now began.
That is the way men now gain their knowledge,
but their wisdom comes otherwise. She looked
upon the forbidden fruit, but no physical change
was perceptible as the result of the misuse of
this sense. This led her to feel more sure that
the argument used had been correct. Her ears
were attentive to the words of the serpent, but
she perceived no change as a result of the
perverted use of the sense of hearing. This,
to the changing mind of the woman, was still
more conclusive proof that the words of Christ
and angels did not mean what she had at first
thought they meant. The senses of touch,
smell, and taste were in turn used, and each
corroborated the conclusion drawn by the devil.
The woman was deceived, and through the
deception her mind was changed. This same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
change of mind may be wrought either by deception
or as a result of false reasoning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A change
in the
mind of
Adam</div>

<p>Eve approached Adam with the fruit
in her hand. Instead of answering in
the oft-repeated words of Christ, “In
the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shalt surely die,” he took up the logic of the
serpent. Having eaten, his mind was also
changed. He who from creation had thought
the thoughts of God, was yielding to the mind
of the enemy. The exactness with which he
had once understood the mind of God was exemplified
when he named the animals; for the
thought of God which formed the animal passed
through the mind of Adam, and “whatsoever
Adam called every living creature, that <i>was</i> the
name thereof.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence
of a
changed
mind</div>

<p>The completeness of the change which
took place is seen in the argument
used when God walked in the garden in
the cool of the evening. Said Adam,
“The woman gave me to eat. Thou gavest me
the woman. Therefore Thou art to blame.”
This was another decidedly logical conclusion,
from the standpoint of the wisdom of the serpent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and it was repeated by Eve, who laid the
blame first on the serpent, and finally on God
himself. Self-justification, self-exaltation, self-worship,—here
was the human origin of the
papacy, that power which “opposeth and exalteth
itself above all that is called God.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spiritual
death the
first result
of sin</div>

<p>The spiritual death which followed the
perversion of the senses was attended,
in time, by physical death. Indeed,
the fruit had scarcely been eaten when
the attention of the man and his wife was
turned toward externals. The soul, which had
enveloped the physical man as a shroud of
light, withdrew, and the physical man appeared.
A sense of their nakedness now appalled them.
Something was lacking; and with all the glory
they had known, with all the truths which
had been revealed, there was nothing to take
the place of the departed spiritual nature.
“Dying, thou shalt die,” was the decree; and
had not the Saviour at this moment made known
to Adam the plan of the cross, eternal death
would have been inevitable.</p>

<p>God, through His instruction, had taught that
the result of faith would be immortal life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Satan taught, and attempted to prove his logic
by a direct appeal to the senses, that there was
immortal life in the wisdom that comes as the
result of human reason. The method employed
by Satan is that which men to-day call the
natural method, but in the mind of God the
wisdom of the world is foolishness. The method
which to the godly mind, to the spiritual nature,
seems natural, is foolishness to the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True education
and
redemption</div>

<p>There are but two systems of education,—the
one based on what God
calls wisdom, the gift of which is eternal
life; the other based on what the
world regards as wisdom, but which God says is
foolishness. This last exalts reason above faith,
and the result is spiritual death. That the fall
of man was the result of choosing the false
system of education can not be controverted.
Redemption comes through the adoption of the
true system of education.</p>

<p>Re-creation is a change of mind,—an exchange
of the natural for the spiritual. “Be
not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed
by the renewing of your mind.” In
order to render such a change possible, Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
must bruise the head of the serpent; that is,
the philosophy of the devil must be disproved
by the Son of God. Christ did this, but in so
doing, his heel, representing his physical nature,
was bruised. The result of the acceptance of
the satanic philosophy has been physical suffering;
and the more completely man yields to the
system built upon that philosophy, the more
complete is the subjection of the race to physical
infirmities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical
degeneracy</div>

<p>After the fall, man turned to coarser
articles of diet, and his nature gradually
became more gross. The spiritual
nature, at first the prominent part of
his being, was dwarfed and overruled until it
was but the “small voice” within. With the
development of the physical and the intellectual
to the neglect of the spiritual, have come
the evils of modern society,—the love of display,
the perversion of taste, the deformity of the body,
and those attendant sins which destroyed Sodom,
and now threaten our cities. Man became careless
in his work also, and the earth failed to
yield her fullness. As a result, thorns and thistles
sprang up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not surprising, after following the decline
of the race, to find that the system of education
introduced by Christ begins with the instruction
given in the garden of Eden, and that it is based
on the simple law of faith. We better appreciate
the gift of Christ when we dwell upon the thought
that while suffering physically, while taking our
infirmities into his own body, He yet preserved
a sound mind and a will wholly subject to the
Father’s, that by so doing the philosophy of
the archdeceiver might be overthrown by the
divine philosophy.</p>

<p>Again, it is but natural to suppose that when
called upon to decide between the two systems of
education, the human and the divine, and Christian
education is chosen, that man will also have
to reform his manner of eating and living. The
original diet of man is again made known, and
for his home he is urged to choose a garden spot,
away from crowded cities, where God can speak
to his spiritual nature through His works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The false
science
and death</div>

<p>God does use the senses of man; but <i>knowledge</i>
thus gained becomes <i>wisdom</i> only when
enlightened by the Spirit, the gateway to whose
fountain is opened by the key of faith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Beneath the tree of life originated the
highest method of education,—the plan
the world needs to-day. Beneath the
branches of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil arose the conflicting system,
having ever one object in view,—the overthrow
of the eternal principles of truth. Under one
guise, then under another, it has borne sway
upon the earth. Whether as Babylonish learning,
Greek philosophy, Egyptian wisdom, the
high glitter of papal pomp, or the more modest
but no less subtle workings of modern science,
the results always have been, and always will be,
a savor of death unto death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true
science of
life</div>

<p>As was the unassuming life of the
Saviour of man when walking the
earth unrecognized by the lordly Pharisees
and wise men of his day, so has
been the progress of truth. It has kept steadily
on the onward march, regardless of oppression.
Men’s minds, clouded by self-worship, fail
to recognize the voice from heaven. It is passed
by as the low mutterings of thunder at the
gate. Beautiful when the Father spoke to his
Son, and the halo of heavenly light encircling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
eternal truth is explained by natural causes.
Man’s reason is opposed to simple faith, but
those who will finally reach the state of complete
harmony with God will have begun where Adam
failed. Wisdom will be gained by faith. Self
will have been lost in the adoration of the great
Mind of the universe, and he who was created
in the image of God, who was pronounced by
the Master Mind as “<i>very good</i>,” will, after the
struggle with sin, be restored to the harmony of
the universe by the simple act of faith.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HISTORY OF FIFTEEN CENTURIES</span></h2>

<p>As a stone, hurled from some mountain peak,
crashes its way toward the valley beneath, gaining
velocity with each foot of descent, until, wrapped
within it, lies a power of destruction unmeasured,
so man, turning from the gate of Paradise, began
a downward career which in intensity and rapidity
can be measured only by the height from which
he started.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
schools
before the
flood</div>

<p>Giant minds held mighty powers in abeyance.
Before the strong will of men of the first ten
centuries few forces could stand. As the plane to
which it was possible for him to attain was perfection,
so the level to which he descended was
confusion itself. Men’s lives, instead of being
narrowed by the brief span of threescore years
and ten, were measured by centuries; and intellects,
mighty by birth, had time as well as power
to expand. The man of seventy was then but a
lad, with life and all its possibilities spread out
before him. Adam lived to see his children to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
eighth generation; and when we think that from
his own lips Enoch learned the story of the fall,
of the glories of the Eden home; when we bear
in mind that Enoch probably saw this same
ancestor laid in the earth, there to molder to
dust, we better understand the relation he desired
to sustain to his God. After a life of three hundred
years, in which, the Sacred Record says,
he “walked with God,” earth’s attraction grew so
slight that he himself was taken into heaven. This
was less than sixty years after the death of Adam.
Passing beyond the gate of Eden, two
classes of minds developed. Clear and
distinct as light from darkness was the
difference between the two. Cain, by
exalting his own reasoning powers, accepted the
logic of Satan. Admitting the physical plane to be
the proper basis for living, he lost all appreciation of
spiritual things, and depended wholly upon feeling.
True, for a time he adhered to the form of worship,
coming week by week to the gate of Eden
to offer sacrifice; but his eye of faith was blind.
When he saw his brother’s sacrifice accepted, a
feeling of hatred sprang up in his breast, and,
raising his hand, he took that brother’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Men are startled at the rapidity of the descent
from Edenic purity to a condition where murder
was easy, but it was the natural result of the
educational system chosen by Cain. Reason exalted
above faith makes man like the engine without
the governor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
developed
in the
worldly
school</div>

<p>Murder, however, was but one result of
the decision made by Cain. He fled
from the presence of God, and, with his
descendants built the cities of the East.
Physical needs predominated, so that
the whole attention of this people was turned to
the gratification of fleshly desires. Pride increased,
love of wealth was a ruling passion; the artificial
took, more and more, the place once occupied by
the natural. In the place of God-worship was
self-worship, or paganism. This was the religious
aspect, and here are to be found the first worshipers
of the sun, the human progenitors of the
modern papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affects
government</div>

<p>As there was a change in religion, so
there was a change in government.
There could no longer be a theocracy,
the father of the family being the high
priest unto God; for God had been lost sight of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and his place was filled by man himself. Hence,
these descendants of Cain flocked together into
cities, where the strong bore rule over the weak,
and thus developed an absolute monarchy, which
is perpetuated to-day in the kingdoms of eastern
Asia.</p>

<p>The education which upheld paganism in religion
and monarchy in government was the same as that
which in later days controlled Greece, and is
known by us to-day as Platonism. It is but
another name for an education which exalts the
mind of man above God, and places human philosophy
ahead of divine philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
false
philosophy</div>

<p>The philosophy which was thus exalted,—this
science falsely so-called,—deified
nature, and would to-day be known as
evolution. You think the name a modern
one. It may be, but the philosophy antedates
the flood, and the schools of those men before the
flood taught for truth the traditions of men as
truly as they are taught to-day.</p>

<p>We think, perhaps, that there were no schools
then, but that is a mistake. “The training of the
youth in those days was after the same order as
children are being educated and trained in this age,—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
love excitement, to glorify themselves, to
follow the imaginations of their own evil hearts.”
Their keen minds laid hold of the sciences; they
delved into the mysteries of nature. They made
wonderful progress in inventions and all material
pursuits. But the imaginations of their hearts were
only evil continually.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City life
unfitted
minds for
truth</div>

<p>Children educated in the cities had their
evil tendencies exaggerated. The philosophical
teaching of the age blotted out
all faith; and when Noah, a teacher of
righteousness, raised his voice against the popular
education, and proclaimed his message of faith,
even the little children scoffed at him.</p>

<p>So polluted were the cities that Enoch chose to
spend much time in retired places, where he could
commune with God, and where he would be in
touch with nature. At times he entered the cities,
proclaiming to the inhabitants the truth given to
him by God. Some listened, and occasionally
small companies sought him in his places of retirement,
to listen to his words of warning. But
the influence of early training, the pressure brought
to bear by society, and the philosophy of the
schools, exerted a power too strong to resist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they turned from the pleadings of conscience to
the old life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antediluvian
science
teaching
was contrary
to
God’s
word</div>

<p>As Noah told of the coming flood, and
as he and his sons continued to build
the ark, men and children derided.
“Water from heaven! Ah, Noah, you
may talk of your spiritual insight, but
who ever heard of water coming out of
the sky? The thing is an impossibility;
it is contrary to all reason, to all scientific
truth, and to all earth’s experience. You may
think such things were revealed to you; but since
the days of our father Adam, no such thing ever
happened.” Such statements seemed true. Generation
after generation had looked into a sky
undarkened by storm-clouds. Night after night
dew watered the growing plants. Why should
they believe otherwise? They could see no <i>reason</i>
for it. To those antediluvians, the possibility of
a flood seemed as absurd as does its recital as a
matter of history to the modern higher critic. It
was out of harmony with men’s senses, hence an
impossibility.</p>

<p>The student in the nineteenth century finds in
the earth’s crust great beds of coal, or the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of monsters which once lived upon the face of the
earth, and he accounts for these by saying that
“<i>time is long</i>.” In the words of Dana, “If time
from the commencement of the Silurian age included
<i>forty-eight millions of years</i>, which <i>some
geologists would pronounce much too low</i> an estimate,
the Paleozoic part, according to the above
ratio, would comprise thirty-six millions, the Mesozoic
nine millions, and the Cenozoic three millions.”
Modern text-books are filled with these and related
ideas of evolution, which account for the
effects of the flood by gradual changes consuming
millions of years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An education
of
sight and
not faith</div>

<p>The Word of God is again laid aside,
and man by his own power of reasoning
draws conclusions contrary to the
testimony of the Inspired Record. The
theory of evolution is thus substantiated in the
human mind; and as the antediluvians were, by
their scientific research and wisdom, falsely so-called,
unfitted to receive the message of the
flood, so people to-day, by pursuing a similar
course, are unfitting themselves for the message
of Christ’s appearance in the clouds of heaven.
When will man learn that there are things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and yet which
exist as really as do those <i>few things</i>—few
compared with the <i>many</i> in the regions beyond—which
fall within our range of vision?</p>

<p>Before the flood, no peal of thunder had ever
resounded among the hills, no lightning had ever
played through the heavens. You who to-day
have read the works of earth’s greatest authors,
who have delved into the secrets of science, have
you discovered the soul of man? Have you yet
found the golden cord of faith? Should the
Almighty question you as He did His servant Job,
how would you pass the examination? To you
would befall the fate of the generation of Noah.
Four men built the ark. Such a thing had never
been seen before. “How unshapely,” say they.
“How absurd to think of water standing over the
earth <i>until that will float</i>!” But in the ears
of the faithful four whispered the still, small
voice of God, and the work went steadily on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flood a
result of
wrong
education</div>

<p>The controversy was an educational
problem. Christian education was almost
wiped from the earth. Worldly
wisdom seemed about to triumph. In
point of numbers its adherents vastly exceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
those in the schools of the Christians. Was
this seeming triumph of evil over good a sign
that evil was stronger than truth?—By no means.
Only in the matter of scheming and deceiving
does the devil have the advantage; for God can
work only in a straightforward manner.</p>

<p>The tree of life was still upon the earth, an
emblem of the wisdom of God. Man, however,
had turned his back upon it. Eating the fruit
of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
brought death, and this the inhabitants of the
earth were about to realize, although their worldly
wisdom taught them the contrary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrong
methods
of education
cause
the withdrawal
of
God’s
Spirit</div>

<p>The tree of life was taken to heaven
before the flood,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> thus symbolizing the
departure of true wisdom from the
earth. The flood came. Deep rumblings
of thunder shook the very earth.
Man and beast fled terrified from the
flashes of lightning. The heavens
opened; the rain fell,—at first in great drops.
The earth reeled and cracked open; the fountains
of the great deep were broken up; water
came from above, water from beneath. A cry
went up to heaven, as parents clasped their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
children in the agony of death; but the Spirit
of the Life-giver was withdrawn. Does this seem
cruel? God had pleaded with each generation,
with each individual, saying, “Why will ye, why
will ye?” But only a deaf ear was turned to
Him. Man, satisfied with schooling his senses,
with depending upon his own reasoning powers,
closed, one by one, every avenue through which
the Spirit of God could work; and nature,
responding to the loss, was broken to her very
heart, and wept floods of tears.</p>

<p>One family, and only one, bound heaven and
earth together. Upon the bosom of the waters
rocked the ark in safety. God’s Spirit rested
there, and in the midst of greater turmoil than
angels had ever witnessed, a peace which passeth
all understanding filled the minds and hearts
of that faithful company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faith the
basis of
the new
education</div>

<p>The waters subsided; the earth lay a desolate
mass. Mountains stood bleak and barren where
once stretched plains of living green. Trees,
magnificent in their towering strength, lay dying
as the waters left the earth. Great masses
of rock covered places hitherto inhabited. This
family came forth as strangers in a strange land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The plan of education must start anew.
Each successive step away from God
rendered more difficult man’s access to
his throne; it had lengthened, as it
were, the ladder one more round.
There was at first this <i>one</i> lesson to be taken
by faith,—that God was true in saying, “In
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die.” It was a lesson of faith versus
reason. Next came <i>two</i> lessons of faith: first,
faith opposed by reason; and, second, the plan
of redemption through Christ. Then came the
<i>third</i> lesson,—the flood. Would that man could
have grasped the first, or, missing that, he had
taken the second, or even losing hold of that,
he could have taken the third by faith, and
prevented the flood.</p>

<p>From beginning to end it was a matter of
education. Christians to-day exalt the material
to the neglect of the spiritual, as surely as did
men before the flood. Shall we not look for
similar results, since similar principles are at
work?</p>

<p>The education of the popular schools advocated
nature study; but, leaving God out, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
deified nature, and accounted for the existence
of all things by the same theories which are
to-day termed evolution. This is man’s theory
of creation with faith dropped out of the calculation.</p>

<p>“This they willingly are ignorant of, that by
the word of God the heavens were of old, and
the earth standing out of the water and in the
water: whereby the world that then was, being
overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens
and the earth, which are now, by the same
word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against
the day of judgment.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>“As it was in the days of Noah, so shall

<span class="smaller">THE SCHOOL OF ABRAHAM</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Rapid
decline
after the
flood</div>

<p>The ease with which men fall into evil
habits is illustrated in the history of the
world after the flood. Upon leaving the
ark, four families who had known God,
had committed to them the peopling of the earth.
But evil tendencies, the result of years of acquaintance
with the iniquity of the antediluvian world,
gained the ascendency, and the sons of Noah,
failing to carry out the principles of true education
in their homes, saw their children drifting away
from God.</p>

<p>True, the bow of promise appeared often in the
heavens as a reminder of the awful results of sin,
and telling them also of the God-Father who
sought their hearts’ service. But again the logic
of the evil one was accepted, and men said, “We
shall not surely die.” As a sign of their confidence
in their own strength they built the tower
of Babel. They had been scattered in the hill
country, where nature and natural scenery tended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to elevate their thoughts. They followed the
valley, and built cities in the low plains.</p>

<p>Not more than a single century had elapsed
since the flood had destroyed all things. The
change was a rapid one. The successive steps in
degeneration are readily traced. They chose an
education of the senses rather than one of faith;
they left the country and congregated in cities; a
monarchy arose. Schools sprang up which perpetuated
these ideas; paganism took the place of
the worship of God. The tower was a monument
to the sun; idols filled the niches in the structure.
Men offered their children as sacrifices.</p>

<p>The slaying of infants and children is but carrying
out in the extreme what is always done
mentally and spiritually when children are taught
false philosophy. That man might not bring upon
himself immediate destruction, the language was
confused, and education in false philosophy thus
rendered more difficult.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abraham
called
from Ur</div>

<p>It was from this influence, as found in
the city of Ur of the Chaldees, that Abraham
was called. Although the family
of Terah knew the true God, and His
worship was maintained in the home, it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for him to counteract the influence of
the city with its idolatrous practices; so God
called Abraham into the country.</p>

<p>He was obliged to go forth by faith. The
removal meant the severing of every earthly tie.
Wealth and ease were exchanged for a wandering
life. How he could make a living Abraham did
not know. How he could educate his children
he did not understand. But he went forth
Terah, his father, and Lot, his nephew, went
with him. They halted at Haran, a smaller city,
and remained there until the father’s death. Then
came the command to go forward. Out into a
new country he went, a pilgrim and a stranger.</p>

<p>“By faith Abraham, when he was called to go
out into a place which he should after receive for
an inheritance, obeyed; <i>and he went out, not</i>
knowing whither he went. By faith he sojourned
in the land of promise, as in a strange country,
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob,
the heirs with him of the same promise; for he
looked for a city which hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God.” “He staggered not
at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
strong in faith.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Called to
teach</div>

<p>It was when the patriarch had journeyed
into this strange land, and knew
not whither he was going, that his
work as a teacher began. The commission of
Christ to the apostles, “Go ye therefore, and
<i>teach</i> all nations,” was not more emphatic than
the command to Abraham. God called him to
teach, and he was to be a teacher of nations.
To the disciples it was said, “All power is
given unto Me; ... go ye therefore, and teach
all nations.” A power was to attend their teaching.
Power is synonymous with life; there is no
power without life, and a teacher has power in
proportion as he <i>lives</i> what he wishes to teach.</p>

<p>Abraham was to be a teacher of nations,
hence he must have power. Power could come
only as the result of a life of faith, and so his
whole life was one continual lesson of faith. Each
experience made him a more powerful teacher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God prepares
Abraham
to teach</div>

<p>His faith grew by trial, and only
as he mounted round by round the
ladder which spanned the gulf twixt
heaven and earth, and which had
seemed to lengthen with each succeeding generation.
A period of not less than twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
years—years filled with doubt, fear, anxiety—was
necessary to bring him to the place where
the name <i>Abraham</i>—the father of nations—could
be rightly claimed by him. Another quarter
of a century rolled over his head, years in which
he watched the growth of the child of promise;
then the voice of God called him to raise his hand
to take the life of that same son. He who had
said that in Isaac should all nations of the earth
be blessed, now demanded the sacrifice of that life
at the father’s hand. But He, the Life-giver in
the event of the child’s birth, was now believed
to be the Life-giver should death rob him of his
child, and the father faltered not.</p>

<p>These fifty years, with God and angels as
teachers, reveal to us, as no other period does,
the results of true education, and merit careful attention.
If the workings of the Spirit ever wrought
changes in the human heart, those changes came to
Abraham. It is not strange that when God called
the first time the voice seemed far away, and
but partially awoke the slumbering soul. As if
in a dream, he, his father, his nephew, and his
wife, broke away from earthly ties and from the
beautiful Chaldean plains, where luxury and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
learning were daily things of life, and journeyed
toward the hill country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How God
taught
faith</div>

<p>It has been stated before that God
teaches by the enunciation of principles,
or universal laws, and the spirit which
comes by faith enlightens the senses
that they may grasp the illustrations of these
laws in the physical world. That is heaven’s
method of teaching the angelic throng, and it
was the method applied before the fall. With
Abraham the case was at the beginning far from
ideal. Here was a pupil lacking faith. How
should he be taught the wisdom of the Eternal?
God leads in a mysterious way. As Christ lived
His visible life, because the eye of faith was blind
in Israel, so, in the time of Abraham, God taught
inductively, as He now says the heathen are to be
taught. To him who had no faith, God came
visibly at first, and, leading step by step, developed
a faith which before his death enabled Abraham
to grasp eternal principles of truth if God but
spoke.</p>

<p>In Ur, God said, “I will make of thee a great
nation, and I will bless thee, and will make thy
name great.” Years passed, age crept on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
still there was no heir. Could he have mistaken
the voice which bade him turn his face
toward Canaan, and promised to him and his
descendants all the land from the “great river,
the river Euphrates, ... unto the great sea
toward the going down of the sun”? “And
Abraham said, Lord God, what wilt Thou give me,
seeing I go childless? Shall it be that my
steward, Eliezer, shall become my heir? Shall
he be the child of promise? Behold, to me
Thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in
my house is mine heir.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>This was man’s way of working out a promise
made by the Maker of the universe. Have <i>we</i>
passed beyond this elementary lesson of faith?
Can <i>we</i> grasp God’s promise of faith, and, with
no fear or thought, leave results with Him who
knows?</p>

<p>No, Abraham; think not that heaven is limited
by the line which bounds thy horizon. “This
shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come
forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.”
And, standing under the starry canopy of heaven,
Abraham’s soul grasped the power of the Creator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
He himself to be a father! His face lighted with
a holy joy as he related to Sarai his experience
with God.</p>

<p>But Sarai bare him no children; and that she
might help heaven fulfill its promise, she forsook
the divine law of marriage, and gave to Abraham
her handmaid, Hagar, to be his wife. Would that
man could grasp at least the beginnings of the
possibilities of God! Untold suffering was the out-growth
of that one step of unbelief. Not one, not
two people, but generations then unborn, had their
destinies marred by this lack of faith. Hagar,
sitting over against her dying child, and weeping
because of the bitterness of her fate, is a constant
portrayal of an attempt to live by sight.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Again,
the approach of the angel and the rescue of the
child records in burning characters the longing of
Him who pities our blindness, and awards us
far above what we can ask or think.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of
Isaac</div>

<p>Ninety-nine years passed over the
patriarch’s head, and still the voice of
heaven’s messenger was greeted with a
laugh when the promise was repeated. Sarah
turned within the tent door when the angel guest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
whom they had fed, repeated to Abraham the
promise concerning his wife. But she bare to
Abraham a son whom God named Isaac, in whom
the nations of the earth were blessed. Joy untold
filled the heart of the mother and father as they
beheld the babe.</p>

<p>This was the joy of sight. Twenty-five years
before, the thing was just as true, and Abraham
might lawfully have worked upon the basis of
its truth; but the stubborn human heart requires
many lessons. Twenty-five years after this, the
strength of Abraham’s faith was tested at the altar
of sacrifice. Leaving home early one morning, he
carried fire, laid wood upon the young man’s shoulders,
and journeyed toward Mount Moriah. “Behold
the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb
for a burnt offering?” asked the son. “God will
provide himself a lamb,” answered the man who
had at last learned to believe God. It is but the
simple story of an ancient patriarch; but the word
of God bears record that “Abraham believed God,
and it was counted to him for righteousness.”</p>

<p>And “if <i>ye</i> be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s
seed and heirs according to the promise.” Herein
lies the value of this lesson to us. We are his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
heirs if we link ourselves to the power of the
Infinite by that cord of faith. Only by a life
and an education such as his can the kingdom
of Christ be set up within. Such lessons made
Abraham a successful teacher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abraham’s
school</div>

<p>Those who wished to worship the true
God gathered about the tents of Abraham,
and became pupils in his school.
God’s word was the basis of all instruction,
as it is written, “These are the commandments, ...
which the Lord your God commanded
to teach you, that ye might do them in the land
whither ye go to possess it.”</p>

<p>This <span class="smcap">word</span> was the basis for the study of political
science, and Abraham’s “methods of government”
were “carried out in the households over
which they [his students] should preside.” The
equality of all men was a lesson first learned in the
home. “Abraham’s affection for his children and
his household led him ... to impart to them a
knowledge of the divine statutes, as the most
precious legacy he could transmit to them, and
through them to the world. All were taught that
they were under the rule of the God of heaven.
There was to be no oppression on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
parents, and no disobedience on the part of children.”
His was not a school where theory alone
was taught, but the practical was emphasized. In
studying political science they formed the nucleus
of a divine government; in the study of finances,
they actually made the money and raised the
flocks which brought recognition from surrounding
nations. “The unswerving integrity, the benevolence
and unselfish courtesy, which had won the
admiration of kings, <i>were displayed in the home</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">This
school was
the beginning
of a
nation</div>

<p>The influence of country life and direct
contact with nature, in contrast with the
enervating influence of the city with its
idolatrous teaching and artificial methods,
developed a hardy race, a people
of faith whom God could use to lay the foundation
for the Israelitish nation. We see, then,
that when God founds a nation, he lays that foundation
in a school. The nation of which Abraham
and his followers formed the beginning,
prefigured the earth redeemed, where Christ will
reign as King of kings. The education of the
school of Abraham symbolized Christian education.</p>

<p>“If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed,
and heirs according to the promise,” not only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the kingdom, but of the education which prepares
the inhabitants for that kingdom.</p>

<p>As faith was the method employed in teaching
in the days of the patriarch, so in the schools of
to-day faith must be the motive for work, the avenue
to the fountain of wisdom. There are to-day
those who can not harmonize their feelings and
their ideas of education with the plan which God
has committed to his people. Likewise in the
days of Abraham there was at least one family
which withdrew from the influence of the school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lot chose
a worldly
school</div>

<p>Lot had felt the effects of the teaching
of Abraham, but through the influence
of his wife, “a selfish, irreligious
woman,” he left the altar where they
once worshiped together, and moved into the
city of Sodom. “The marriage of Lot, and his
choice of Sodom for a home, were the first links
in a chain of events fraught with evil to the
world for many generations.” Had he alone
suffered, we would not need to follow the history;
but the choice of a new home threw his
children into the schools of the heathen; pride
and love of display were fostered, marriage with
Sodomites was a natural consequence, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
final destruction in the burning city was the terrible
but inevitable result.</p>

<p>“When Lot entered Sodom, he fully intended
to keep himself free from iniquity, and to command
his household after him. But he signally
failed. The corrupting influences about him had
an effect upon his own faith, and his children’s
connection with the inhabitants of Sodom bound
up his interests in a measure with theirs.”</p>

<p>The statement is a familiar one, that schools
should be established where an education differing
from that of the world can be given,
because parents are unable to counteract the
influence of the schools of the world. The experience
of Lot is a forcible reminder of the
truth of the statement. And the injunction to
“remember Lot’s wife,” should serve as a warning
to Christians against flocking into the cities
to give children an education. The words of
Spalding are true: “Live not in a great city,
for a great city is a mill which grinds all grain
into flour. Go there to get money or to preach
repentance, but go not there to make thyself a
nobler man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The two systems of education are nowhere
more vividly portrayed than in the experiences
of Abraham and Lot. Education in the tents
of Abraham, under the guidance of the Spirit of
Jehovah, brought eternal life. Education in the
schools of Sodom brought eternal death. This
was not an unnatural thing. You can not find
here any arbitrary work on the part of God.
To partake of the fruit of the tree of life,
imparts life. But of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil it has been said, “In the day
that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”</p>

<p>The system of education revealed to Abraham,
would, if fully carried out, have placed
Israel on a plane of existence above the nations
of the world. It was a spiritual education, reaching
the soul by a direct appeal to faith, and
would have placed the people of God as teachers
of nations. Not a few only were intended
to teach, but the nation as a whole was to
teach other nations. The second Israel will
occupy a similar position, and they will be
brought to that position by means of Christian
education.</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">EDUCATION IN ISRAEL</span></h2>

<p>“Therefore sprang there even of one, and
him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the
sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the
seashore innumerable.” As God dealt with the
one man, so He dealt with the nation. As He had
led the man from a lowly plane to an exalted
position, so He led the nation until they stood a
spectacle to the whole world. He chose them not
because of their great numbers, but, taking the
fewest of men, He wished to show to the world
what could be done by the power of love.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Israel a
peculiar
people</div>

<p>This small people, however, were intended
to lead the world, and lead it in
every sense of the word. That they
might lead instead of being led, He made
them a peculiar people unto Himself, giving them
in the first place the rite of circumcision, which
put a barrier forever between the believer in the
God of Israel and all the nations of the world.
This separation was for a purpose. The fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
they were to be peculiar in the eyes of the other
nations was merely a precautionary step, not a
thing of importance in itself. God had a mission
for the nation; and in order that it might be
accomplished, every effort must be bent in that
direction. Oneness of purpose is a divine law;
and that Israel might lead, Israel must occupy a
position in advance of all other peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Planes of
existence</div>

<p>Men live on various planes. There are
those so constituted physically as to be
content with the gratification of physical
wants and desires. These can readily be led by
men who live on a mental plane; for mind has
ever been recognized as superior to matter, so
that without knowing it, the physically strong
yields to his mental superior. Almost unconscious
of his power, the man on the mental
plane guides and controls those on the physical
plane; he can not help it. It is a natural law;
the one leads, the other follows. Two individuals,
one living in one of these spheres and
the other in the sphere above, will never contend
on account of principle; for the man physically
organized finds it natural to follow the
dictates of the other. This is, and always has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
been, the condition of society. Nature herself
singles out the leaders. They are born, not made,
for leadership. They are the few, it is true; the
masses always prefer to be led.</p>

<p>But it was not as mere mental leaders that God
called Israel. There is above the mental a still
higher plane, the ladder to reach which is scaled
by very few. As the numbers decrease while
passing from the physical to the mental plane, so
they decrease yet more in passing from the mental
to the <i>spiritual</i> plane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How men
reach the
spiritual
plane</div>

<p>Man reaches this highest plane of existence
only by faith. It requires constant
self-denial and continual development.
In reality it is living as seeing Him who
is invisible. The physical man depends almost
entirely on knowledge gained through the senses.
The mentally developed depends upon reason.
Many combine these two natures, and such individuals
are guided by the sense of reason just in
proportion as the two natures are developed.
Knowledge as a result of sense perceptions and
finite reason capture the majority of mankind.
The life of faith, the walking with God, takes in
the few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Israel
should
live on
the spiritual
plane</div>

<p>Do you see why God chose a small
people? He chose them, as a nation,
to be priests or teachers unto Himself.
As individuals, and as a nation, Israel
was to stand upon the spiritual plane,
attaining and maintaining the position by a life of
faith. Standing there, it would be in accordance
with the natural law for all on the lower planes to
yield obedience. As the mental controls the physical
without any friction, so the spiritual controls
all others. Therefore (for this reason) said the
Lord, “I have taught you statutes and judgments....
Keep therefore and do them; for this is your
wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the
nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and
say, Surely this great nation <i>is a wise and understanding
people</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Israel as
teachers
of the
world</div>

<p>Statutes in themselves can not command
respect for any people, but God gave
Israel a manner of life which linked
them with Himself. Living on a spiritual
plane, all the world looked to them for guidance.
As one can not reach up and help those
above him, but must come from above and lift
others to himself, so Israel was pointed to a life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
which made others follow in spite of themselves,
while at the same time they were following what
they knew to be the truth. This is the exalted
position which truth has ever held.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peculiarity
depended
upon the
system of
education</div>

<p>Granting it clear that Israel would lead
by virtue of the plane of existence upon
which they stood, and that this was
attained by a life of faith, it is easily
seen why there was marked out for the
nation a <i>system of education</i> differing as completely
from the systems of the other nations of
the world as the spiritual life differs from a purely
physical or a strictly mental existence. It made it
impossible for any mingling of systems to take
place without the utter ruin of the spiritual; for
as soon as this came down to the level of either of
the others, it ceased to be spiritual, and lost its
power to lead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Result of
mixture
in educational
systems</div>

<p>Should Israel attempt to adopt the
education of surrounding nations, that
moment her education would become
papal in character, for it would then be
a combination of the divine with the
worldly. If a man-made theocracy, a church and
state government, is papal in principle, the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and the worldly combined in educational systems
is no less a papal principle. Israel formed such a
combination more than once, but with the results
recorded in Ps. 106:34-38: “They mingled among
the heathen, and learned their works. And they
served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters
into devils, and shed innocent blood, even the
blood of their <i>sons</i> and of their <i>daughters</i>, whom
they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan.”</p>

<p>Truth and error never form a compound, although
they may be mingled. The union of the two never
produces truth, and the end is death. Truth
amalgamated with error, as gold with mercury, lies
dormant until released. Israel could not positively
forsake her God-given forms of education
without relinquishing her place as leader of nations.
Destined to be the head and not the tail, she immediately
reversed her position when she adopted
a mixed system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spiritual
nature of
their education</div>

<p>The education which was outlined for
the children of Israel was soul-culture,
pure and simple. Its object was to
develop the soul which is God in man;
and Divinity so planned that every true Jew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should be a God-man. Education was to develop
the spark of divinity bestowed at birth,
and it was the privilege of every Jew to have,
as did that <i>One</i> Jew, Christ, the Spirit without
measure.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, what the plan was which
would take the newborn babe, and follow him
through life, making him one unit in a nation of
spiritual beings. God recognized prenatal influence,
and so gave directions and laws concerning
the life of the parents. This is illustrated in the
story of Hannah and the wife of Manoah, in
Elizabeth, and in Mary the mother of Jesus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jewish
schools</div>

<p>In the early history of the nation, “Education,”
says Painter, “was restricted
to the family, in which the father was
the principal teacher. There were no popular
schools nor professional teachers. Yet the instruction
of the Jew ... embraced a vast number
of particulars.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Hinsdale says: “Jewish education
began with the mother. What the true Jewish
mother, considered as a teacher, was, we know
from both the Testaments and from many other
sources. The very household duties that she performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
molded her children in accordance with the
national discipline. ‘The Sabbath meal, the kindling
of the Sabbath lamp, and the setting apart
of a portion of the dough from the bread for the
household—these are but instances with which
every <i>Taph</i>, as he clung to his mother’s skirts,
must have been familiar.’ The bit of parchment
fastened to the doorpost, on which the name of
the Most High was written, ... would be among
the first things to arrest his attention.</p>

<p>“It was in the school of the mother’s knee that
the stories of patriarchs and prophets, of statesmen
and warriors, of poets and sages, of kings and
judges, wise men and patriots, and of the great
Law-giver Himself,—the whole forming the very
best body of material for the purposes of child-nurture
found in any language,—were told and
retold until they became parts of the mind itself.”
He then mentions the case of Timothy, and adds:
“As teachers of their children, the women of
every country may learn lessons from the matrons
of Israel.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This was evidently the original plan,
and had the families proved faithful to the trust,
the greater part, if not all, of the education would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
have been in the <i>family school</i>. Always, however,
as long as Israel was a nation, the child (and the
term covered the first twelve or fifteen years) was
under the instruction of the parents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jewish
church
schools</div>

<p>From the home school we follow the
Jewish child to the synagogue or church
school. Moses was instructed by the
Lord to make every priest a teacher, so
the nation had a whole tribe of teachers. As every
town had its synagogue, so “a town in which
there is no school must perish.” Quoting again
from Hinsdale: “The children were gathered for
instruction in the synagogues and schoolhouses,
where the teacher, generally the Chazzan, or
officer of the synagogue, ‘imparted to them the
precious knowledge of the law, with constant
adaptation to their capacity, with unwearied patience,
intense earnestness, strictness tempered by
kindness, but, above all, with the highest object of
their training ever in view. <i>To keep children from
all contact with vice; to train them to gentleness,
even when bitterest wrong had been received</i>; to
show sin in its repulsiveness, rather than to terrify
by its consequences; <i>to train to strict truthfulness</i>;
to avoid all that might lead to disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
or indelicate thoughts; and to do all this without
showing partiality, without either undue severity
or laxity of discipline, with judicious increase of
study and work, with careful attention to thoroughness
in acquiring knowledge—all this and
more constituted the ideal set before the teacher,
and made his office of such high esteem in
Israel.’”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> These teachers took the youth at the
most critical period of their development. And
how thoroughly they understood the needs of the
developing minds!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools
of the
prophets</div>

<p>In the days of Samuel we read, for the
first time, of the schools of the prophets,
where young men were gathered together
for the study of the law, of music,
poetry, and history, and of the various trades.
The name <i>School of the Prophets</i> would indicate
the spirituality of their work, and reference to the
time of Elijah and Elisha and the experience of
Saul would prove the truth of the inference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Studies in
Jewish
schools</div>

<p>Concerning the subjects taught we are
not left in ignorance, if we study the history
of the people. Thus, quoting again
from Painter: “The Hebrew parent was
not only to impart oral instruction to his children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
but to teach them also <i>reading and writing</i>. As
he was to inscribe the words of the Lord upon his
doorposts and gates, he must himself have learned
to write; and, as he wrote them for his children,
they must have been taught to read. Hence, it
appears that the ability to read and write was
general among the ancient Jews; and, in this
particular, they surpassed every other nation of
antiquity.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Hinsdale says: “From the teaching
of the alphabet, or writing in the primary school,
to the farthest limit of instruction in the academies
of the rabbis, all was marked by extreme care,
wisdom, accuracy, and moral and religious purpose
as the ultimate object.”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bible
as a text-book</div>

<p>“Up to ten years of age the Bible
was the sole text-book; from ten to fifteen
the <i>Mischna</i>, or traditional law, was
used; and after that the pupil was admitted
to the discussions of the rabbinical schools.
So extensive a course of study, however, was
taken only by those who showed decided aptitude
for learning. Bible study began with the book
of Leviticus; then came other parts of the Pentateuch;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
next the prophets, and finally the Hagiography.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Physiology</div>

<p>In working for this chosen people, God
cured physical infirmities with the same
case that he healed a sin-sick soul; and
with the laws for spiritual growth were given directions
for the preservation of health. Every priest
was likewise a physician, and the laws concerning
the use of simple, healthful foods, proper breathing,
ventilation, the use of disinfectants, the bath,
etc., were familiar to all who read the statutes
of Jehovah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Additional
studies</div>

<p>Painter says, concerning other subjects
taught: “Among the potent educational
agencies of the Jews, that of the
annual national festivals merits consideration....
Commemorating important national events, they
kept the people acquainted with their past <i>history</i>....
These frequent reunions not only contributed
to national and religious unity, but they exerted a
strong educating influence upon the people.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>“The Levites, more than other Hebrews, were
to study the book of the <i>law</i>; to preserve and disseminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
it in exact copies; to perform the duties
of <i>judges</i> and <i>genealogists</i>, and consequently to be
theologians, jurists, and historians.... As the
priests and Levites were to test the accuracy of
weights and measures, ... it was necessary that
they should understand something of <i>mathematics</i>;
and as they were to determine and announce the
movable feasts, new moons, years, and intercalary
years, they had occasion for the study of <i>astronomy</i>,”
says Jahn.</p>

<p>Since the schools of the prophets flourished in
the days of Saul and David, it would not be surprising
if David gained some of his musical skill
there as well as on the hillside tending sheep, for
<i>poetry and music</i> formed part of the course of
instruction in these schools. One author pays high
tribute to these subjects by saying: “Greek poetry
is beautiful; Hebrew poetry is sublime.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
Jewish
education</div>

<p>When children were fortified by such
an education from infancy to manhood,
it is little wonder that the influence
which the nation “has exerted upon the
world is incalculable. It has supplied the basis of
all true theology; it has given a system of faultless
morality; and, in Christianity, it has provided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
most perfect form of religion. The civilization of
<i>Europe</i> and <i>America</i> can be directly traced to the
Jews.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>What might have been the result had the nation
lived up to its privileges in educational lines is not
difficult to determine. Earth’s history would have
been shortened by at least two thousand years; for
the nation would never have gone into bondage,
and Christ would never have been betrayed. As
these principles of Christian education are again
taking hold of people, with what interest must
the progress of the work be watched by the inhabitants
of other worlds, who have seen past failures
through lack of faith! That Hebrew education
tended mainly to a development of the inner man
instead of giving merely a conglomeration of facts,
is well expressed by Wines. He says: “The
Hebrew law required an early, constant, vigorous,
and efficient training of the disposition, judgment,
manners, and habits, both of thought and feeling.
The sentiments held to be proper to man in society
were imbibed with the milk of infancy. The manners
considered becoming in adults were sedulously
imparted in childhood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The threefold
nature
educated</div>

<p>The education, however, was not only
moral and intellectual, but physical as
well; for every Jewish boy was taught
some trade which rendered him self-supporting.
Nor did wealth or position remove the
need of this. Paul, who sat at the feet of Gamaliel
while studying the law, was able to gain a livelihood
as a tentmaker when preaching the gospel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True teaching
exemplified</div>

<p>There was, however, in it all this one
thought: all instruction was intended
to develop the spiritual nature. It was
considered the highest honor to become
a priest (every Jew might have been both priest
and teacher), and in this office man stood next
to God. This was wholly a spiritual position,
and prefigured the work of the Messiah. True,
Israel as a nation never reached the standard set
for her, never mounted, as it were, that ladder
reaching from earth to heaven; and it was left
for the One Man, the Master of Israel, to bind
together the two realms of the physical and the
spiritual. But from time to time men arose in
the Jewish nation who grasped in a far broader
sense than the majority, the meaning of true
education as delivered to the Jews, and who, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
submitting to the educating influence of the Spirit
of God, were enabled to become leaders of the
people and representatives of God on earth. Such
were Moses, Daniel, Job, and Ezekiel, and, to a
certain extent, all the prophets of Israel. In each
of these the soul rose above the physical man,
until it met its parent force in the heart of God.
This made it possible for Moses to talk face to
face with the Father, and for Ezekiel to follow
the angel of revelation to the border land of
God’s home.</p>

<p>These men were but enjoying what <i>every man in
Israel</i> might have experienced had the nation
remained upon the plane to which they were
called, receiving their education by faith. One is
tempted to ask why they fell. The answer is the
same as to that other question, Why do not we
arise? They ceased to look upward; faith failed,
and reason took its place, and instead of leading
they sought to be like the nations about them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worldly
systems
of education</div>

<p>There lay Egypt, with its mighty men,
and the carnal heart longed for some
of the Egyptian display. To understand
it, we must again consider the
difference in life and education. Life on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
spiritual plane means whole self-forgetfulness;
but when carnal desires are heeded, a fall is
inevitable. Egyptian education was largely on
the physical basis. It is true that mental heights
were reached, but only by the few, and those few,
bound by earth’s fetters, were unable to break
entirely away. The masses, not only in education
but in religion, were physical, and <i>basely physical</i>.
The sacred bull was a personification of deity.
Why?—Because God, to an Egyptian, was an
embodiment of lust. All their gods, all their
rites and ceremonies, every temple wall and religious
service, breathed the dreadful odor of licentiousness.
Historians state that the priestly class
knew better. And so they did; but their grasp
was not that of truth, else they could never have
been the priests and teachers of such a religion
or of such a system of education.</p>

<p>These words, put in the mouth of an ancient
Egyptian priest, speak truly the spirit of Egyptian
education. He says: “I that have seen nigh four-score
years of misery; ... I that have mastered
all the arts, sciences, and religion of ancient
Egypt—a land that was wrinkled with age centuries
before the era of Moses; I that know both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
all that the priests of Kem ever taught the people,
and also the higher and more recondite forms of
ignorance in which the priests themselves believed—I
verily know nothing! I can scarcely believe
in anything <i>save universal darkness</i>, for which
no day-spring cometh, and universal wretchedness
for which there is no cure. O wretched
man that I am, who shall deliver me from this
death?”</p>

<p>And yet the Jews would leave that education
which offered eternal life, for this which the best-educated
Egyptian might acknowledge to be darkness
and only darkness. It was from this that God
delivered Israel; but many to-day, claiming to be
Israel in Spirit, seek still the wisdom and philosophy
of Egypt for themselves and their children.
Israel could not come in touch with this form of
life without contamination. Nay, more, she fell
from her exalted state, and never reached it again.
“Jerusalem was destroyed because the education
of her children was neglected.”</p>

<p>The ceremonial law given after leaving Sinai, at
the beginning of that memorable march of forty
years, was necessary because the nation had lost
all appreciation of the spiritual in the abstract, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
could gain no idea whatever of God as a <i>Spirit</i>
except through some appeal to the physical senses.
This condition was due to the fact that four generations
had been subject to Egyptian education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Israel
at the
Exodus</div>

<p>The plan of types and ceremonies alone
appealed to the mind. And even in
this inductive method of teaching, the
nation seemed slow to learn; for the
forty years between the Red Sea and Jordan
served to develop scarcely enough faith to carry
the people into the promised land. God’s law,
written on the tablets of the heart by the pen
of faith, appealed to but few. Men ate manna
from heaven, but knew not that it was the
token of a crucified Saviour: they drank of water
flowing constantly from the smitten rock, never
dreaming that it prefigured the shed blood of the
dying Son of God. Once settled in Canaan, the
whole system of education was so planned as to
teach the child to accept Christ by faith. Some
grasped this spiritual truth; but a few had eyes
which saw the things hidden from the multitude,
because faith was an avenue to the very soul.</p>

<p>Having the privilege of living by faith, and
accepting the divine teaching in this its highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
form, they preferred the old way, and walked by
sight. “Except ye see, ye will not believe;” “O
ye of little faith.” When we look at what the
Israelites might have been, and then at what they
were, there is a feeling of intense pain, for the
fall is inexpressibly great. By little and little,
Jehovah strove to reach the higher nature again,
and bring Israel to its heaven-selected place.
There was steady progress until the days of Solomon,
whose wisdom outshone that of the great
men of earth, and Israel as a nation was again on
the verge of becoming the leading people of the
world politically, intellectually, and morally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solomon’s
wisdom</div>

<p>Solomon was raised to a position of eminence
among the great men of earth
because he learned from God the secret
of true education. His wisdom was not a gift to
him exclusively, but was offered to all who would
comply with the educational requirements. Of
Solomon we read that God gave him a hearing
ear. His spiritual senses were awakened by faith,
and he found himself so in harmony with the God
of nature that all the works of the Creator were
read by him as an open book. His wisdom seemed
great in contrast with that of other Jews merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
because others failed to live up to their privileges.
God desired the whole nation to stand before other
people as Solomon stood before the kings of the
earth.</p>

<p>The surprising feature to most students is the
fact that the system of education given by God
will, when followed, open to man such material
benefits. It is not, as it is often accused of being,
ideal and theoretical, but lacking the practical.
On the contrary, it is of the most practical nature,
and opens to its followers all legitimate lines of
prosperity, placing its devotees above all contestants.
This is seen in the experience of the king
just mentioned. As a statesman and lawyer,
Solomon was noted; as a scientist, he excelled
the scholars of the world; for wealth and splendor,
the half has not been told; during his reign Jewish
architecture, as exemplified in the temple, assumed
such grandeur that it became the model for even
the æsthetic Greek. In tilling the soil and raising
fruit it was always intended that Israel should
excel other nations.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Youth were trained to fill
positions of trust, and were taught the practical
duties of everyday life. Such training was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to girls as well as to boys, fitting them to fill
properly their allotted sphere as housewives and
mothers in Israel.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>From the fall which followed this exaltation,
Israel never recovered. The educational system
losing its true character, the nation was at last
carried into captivity. When the Hebrew race
lost the spirituality of their education, they lost
everything; for political power, national reputation,
all, hung upon one thread. “Jerusalem was
destroyed because the education of her children
was neglected.” This destruction did not come
suddenly. There was a decline, then a forward
lunge, and another relapse, each time the fall
being greater and the reaction weaker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An educational
reform</div>

<p>Several times a halt was made, and the
national life was prolonged by a return
to the prescribed methods of education.
Jehoshaphat, for instance, appointed Levites
as teachers to the different cities of Israel,
and, as a result, “The fear of the Lord fell upon
all the kingdoms of the lands that were round
about Judah, so that they made no war.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Had
the reform been carried on which was then begun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the whole national history would have been
changed.</p>

<p>Another noticeable fact is that release from
bondage was always heralded by two reforms.
For instance, before deliverance from Babylon,
Daniel was raised up to give the people instruction
in health reform and educational reform.
These two always accompany each other. The
one affects the body, preparing it to become the
temple of the Holy Ghost; the other turns the
mind toward truth, that the Spirit of God may
think through it. A body purified by right living,
and a mind trained according to the laws of Christian
education, brings an experience such as Daniel
had.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> That he lived on a plane above the majority
of men is evident; for “I, Daniel, alone
saw the vision: for the men that were with me
saw not the vision.” What to Daniel was the
voice of God those whose ears were not in tune
with the Infinite heard as thunder or as an earthquake.
It had been the privilege of all to see and
hear as Daniel saw and heard, but they chose a
coarser life, a slower vibratory existence, where
the mental strain was less, and the heart strings
were looser. It was easier to keep in tune with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Egypt or Babylon than with the God of heaven.
And when the Son of Man was born, he found it
hard to select even a small company whose lives
were in harmony with His own.</p>

<p>Israel’s education was a spiritual education.
Her King was to set up a spiritual kingdom in
the hearts of a people spiritualized by the presence
of truth. It was the same system which
had been delivered by Christ to Adam; the same
by which Abraham was taught; and what was not
accomplished in the ages past will be accomplished
by Christian education in the days preparatory to
His second coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="VII">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE PAGAN WORLD</span></h2>

<p>God called Israel to become a nation of teachers,
and gave them statutes and judgments which,
when made the basis of the educational systems,
tended to make of the nation a peculiar people,
a nation of priests, a spiritual race, thereby
constituting them the leading people of the world.
From what did he call them?—“The Lord hath
taken you, and brought you forth out of the <i>iron
furnace, <span class="smcap">out of Egypt</span></i>.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> And again, “Out of
Egypt have I called my Son.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Egypt stands as
a personification of the heathen world, and its
very name means darkness. The dark mantle of
paganism has ever obstructed the bright shining
of the light of truth.</p>

<p>As Israel’s power, physical, intellectual, and
political, was derived from, and depended upon,
her system of education, so it would be but
natural to suppose that the opposing power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
paganism would possess educational ideas, and be
controlled by a system of instruction in harmony
with its practices. Or, to state it more logically,
we necessarily conclude that the pagan world
rested upon a distinct system of education, and
that the customs and practices of pagan nations
were the result of the educational ideas which
they advocated.</p>

<p>The God-given system, as found among the
Hebrews, rested upon faith, and developed the
spiritual side of man’s nature, making it possible
in the highest sense for divinity to unite
with humanity. The result of this union of the
human and the divine—the Immanuel—is the
highest creation of the universe. It in itself was
a power before which men and demons bowed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paganism
self-worship</div>

<p>As to paganism and its system of education,
what was the religion of the
pagan world? and what were the ideas
it strove to propagate? First, it placed
above God the study and worship of self. Christ
is the “true light that lighteth every man that
cometh into the world.” All men have, then,
at some time in life, light enough to lead them
to truth, for the gospel “reveals a divine anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
from heaven upon all wickedness and iniquity of
men who <i>pervert the true into the false</i>; because
the knowledge of God is clear within themselves,
God having revealed it to them; for from the
creation of the world His invisible attributes
might be discovered from the created facts,—that
is, His unseen power and Godhead. Consequently,
they are inexcusable.”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Men, therefore, who of necessity have light
may reject that light, and they then become
pagan. Paul, in the first chapter of his Roman
letter, states a universal law in that when truth
is rejected, error takes its place. The quotation
is again taken from Fenton’s translation, because
the wording, by differing slightly from the authorized
version, stimulates thought: “Because, knowing
God, they did not honor Him as a God, or
rejoice, but trifled in their augmentations, and
darkened their senseless hearts; <i>professing to be
philosophers, they</i> played the fool, and transformed
the glory of the imperishable God into
an image of perishable man, and birds! and
beasts! and reptiles! And, therefore, God abandoned
them in the lusts of their hearts to filthiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to dishonor their own bodies to themselves;
they having changed the truth of God into falsehood,
by honoring and serving the creature
contrary to the Creator, who is truly blessed
in all ages.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Having turned from the worship of Jehovah
to the worship of man, then bird, and beast, and
reptile, we find associated with worship the grossest
forms of licentiousness. This is stated by Paul
in the first chapter of Romans. The thought which
must be borne in mind is that man turns from God
and worships himself. He can conceive of no
power higher than his own mind, no form more
lofty than his own. His first idol is the human
form, male or female. He endows this with
human passions, for he knows no heart but his
own. By beholding he becomes changed into the
same passionate creature; a beast becomes the
personification of his deity, and the sacred bull his
god. Everything about the worship is gross, and
birds, crocodiles, and all sorts of reptiles become
objects of worship. This is Egypt. This, in fact,
pictures the final worship in any country which
turns from Christ and places faith in man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a variety of forms in worship, as
there are a variety of complexions in the men of
different countries; but it is one and the same plan
throughout, resting upon one system of education,
producing the same results, whether traced
in the proud Babylonish court, the loathsome
filth of Egypt, Greece with its intellectual pride
and culture, in Roman law, or in the more modern
European countries. Paganism is the green-eyed
monster, crouching on the southern shore of the
Mediterranean, whose body follows the course of
the Nile, whose paws reach both east and west,
and whose breath has poisoned the atmosphere
of all Europe. Into those eyes men have gazed
expecting to find wisdom. It was but the glare of
the demon, as the tiger’s gaze at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egyptian
religion
and
education</div>

<p>For Egypt itself, it blotted out all individual
rights, placing the masses as a
common herd writhing in superstition
under the hands of a tyrannical king and
a scheming priesthood. It was indeed “an iron
furnace,” as God had called it, and as Israel had
found by sad experience. It was tyranny in
government; it was still more bitter tyranny in
education and religion. As well might one strive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to move the pyramids, or get words from the silent
sphinx, as to hope to change the life in Egypt by
means of anything presented in Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cultivation
of the
senses</div>

<p>Of Egyptian education, Jahn says: The
“priests were a separate tribe, ...
and they performed not only the services
of religion but the duties of all civil
offices to which learning was necessary. They
therefore devoted themselves in a peculiar manner
to the cultivation of <i>the sciences</i>.... They
studied natural philosophy, natural history, medicine,
mathematics (particularly astronomy and
geometry), history, civil polity, and jurisprudence.”
Place this course of study by the side
of Jewish education, and you notice in the latter
the Bible and such subjects as tended to develop
spirituality, those things which faith alone could
grasp; while the education of the Egyptian had an
entirely intellectual basis, and dealt with those
subjects which appeal to the senses and to human
reason.</p>

<p>When this system as a system is traced in
other countries, especially in Greece, this characteristic
becomes startling in the extreme; and if
reference is made to it often in contrast to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Jewish system, it is because herein lies the pivot
upon which the history of nations revolves. It is
either faith or reason to-day, as it has been faith
opposed to reason throughout the ages. In place
of reason use the word <i>philosophy</i>, for that was a
favorite expression among the pagans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pagan
philosophy
folly</div>

<p>The gospel has stood opposed to the
philosophy of the world since the beginning;
hence we read, “For the reason of
the Cross is certainly folly to the reprobate,
but to us, the saved, it is a divine power;
for it is written, ‘I will destroy the philosophy of
the philosophers, and upset the cleverness of the
clever.’ Where is the philosopher? where is the
scholar? where is the investigator of this age?
Has not God made the <i>philosophy</i> of this world
folly? For when in the <i>divine philosophy</i> the
world did not perceive God through the philosophy,
it pleased God to save the faithful by means of the
folly of preaching. As, however, Jews demand a
sign, and Greeks seek after philosophy, we now
proclaim a crucified Christ, a certain offense to the
Jews, and joke to the heathen, but to the called,
whether Jews or Greeks,—Christ a divine power
and a divine philosophy.... For observe your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
calling, brothers, that there are not many <i>fashionable
philosophers</i>, nor many powerful men, nor
many of high birth.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It is this divine philosophy which the spiritually
minded grasp, and which is the sum and substance
of their education. It is this human philosophy,
or natural philosophy, which in the sight of God
is folly, that Egypt and her followers adopted.
Minds delving into human philosophy never find
God, nor do they approach the realms of divine
philosophy. There is a <i>divine philosophy</i>, and it is
grasped by faith; and there is a human philosophy,
a creation of the human mind, a science formulated
from deductions which appeal to natural
senses. But the man, wisest in human learning
alone, remains still a fool in the eyes of God,
for the inner man has not been reached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egyptian
wisdom</div>

<p>Our study of pagan education is not,
however, confined to the Nile Valley.
Indeed, some of the most interesting
phases, some of the strongest features of the system,
were developed elsewhere. Egypt was the
cradle, but Greece and Rome were fields in which
these ideas gained strength. We read: “The
ancients looked upon Egypt as a school of wisdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Greece sent thither illustrious philosophers and
lawgivers—Pythagoras and Plato, Lycurgus and
Solon—to complete their studies.” “<i>Hence, even
the Greeks</i> in ancient times were <i>accustomed to
borrow their politics and their learning</i> from the
Egyptians.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spartan
education
and Egypt</div>

<p>Of the four men mentioned, we look
upon Lycurgus as the founder of the
Spartan government, noted for the physical
training it gave and the utter subjection
of the individual to the state. Every
historian recognized this as due to the <i>system of
education</i> introduced by Lycurgus, and followed
out by his people. The newborn babe was adjudged
worthy of life or death by a council of the
state, the decision being based on the physical
condition of the infant. At the age of seven the
child became the property of the state, and so
remained until sixty. It was more exclusively a
physical or purely secular education than that
offered elsewhere on earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athens
and Egypt</div>

<p>The prosperity of Athens, where was
“wrought out the most perfect form of
heathen civilization,” dates from the
time of Solon, who, as we have already learned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<i>finished his education in Egypt</i>. In these two
men we see the leaning toward the physical side,
made so prominent in pagan education. “The
course of study in the school of Pythagoras embraced
mathematics, physics, metaphysics, and
medicine. Especial prominence was given mathematics,
which Pythagoras regarded as the noblest
science.” Here is revealed the inclination of the
pagan education toward the purely intellectual.
Of Plato we shall read later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Egyptian
education
universal</div>

<p>If Egypt offered ground for the germination
of the seed of pagan education,
Greece brought the plant to its seed-producing
state; and Rome, acting as
the wind with the thistle down, <i>scattered pagan
education broadcast</i>. Of Rome we read: “It
gathered into its arms the elements of Grecian
and Oriental culture, and as its end drew nigh,
it scatters them freely over the rest of Europe.
Rome has been the bearer of culture to the
modern world.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato in
education</div>

<p>In order to understand the fertility of
the seeds of pagan education, it is necessary
to regard with care the master
mind of that system, and this we find in Plato.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Emerson, in his “Representative Men,” defines
his position and the position of his philosophy in
the pagan and in the so-called Christian world,
making the teachings of this Greek, schooled in
Egypt, crowd out the Word of God itself. He
says: “Out of Plato come all things that are
still written and debated among men of thought....
<i>The Bible</i> of the learned for twenty-two
hundred years, every brisk young man, who says
in succession fine things to each reluctant generation
( ... Erasmus, Bruno, Locke, Rousseau,
Coleridge) is some reader of Plato.”</p>

<p>That is saying that for twenty-two hundred
years Plato and his educational system, known
everywhere as Platonism, have taken the <i>place
of the Bible to the leading minds of the world</i>.
“Plato is philosophy, and philosophy, Plato,—at
once the glory and the shame of mankind, since
neither Saxon nor Roman have availed to add
any idea to his categories,” continues Emerson.
“No wife, no children had he, and the <i>thinkers
of all civilized nations are his posterity</i>, and <i>are
tinged</i> with his mind. How many great men
nature is incessantly sending up out of night, to
be <i>his men,—Platonists</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he gives a list of illustrious names who
have stood for learning in the various ages of
the world’s history, and continues: “Calvinism
is in his [Plato’s] <i>Phædo</i>: Christianity is in it.”
How little this writer knew of the power of the
truth as given by Christ! Doubtless he formed
his judgment from professedly Christian teachers.
But he continues: “Mahometanism draws all its
philosophy, in its handbook of morals, ...
from him [Plato]. Mysticism finds in Plato all
its texts. This citizen of a town in Greece is
no villager nor patriot. An Englishman reads,
and says, ‘How English!’ a German, ‘How
Teutonic!’ an Italian, ‘How Roman and how
Greek!’” And to show that the recognition
of Plato is not stopped by the Atlantic, our
versatile New England writer says: “Plato
seems, to a reader in New England, an American
genius.” Has the reader any suspicion
that our American educational institutions may
have recognized the universality of this master
of philosophy, and adopted into their curricula
his system of reasoning? One traces, without
the aid of magnifiers, the thread of pagan philosophy
throughout the American schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“As our Jewish Bible has implanted itself in
the table talk and household life of every man
and woman in the European and American
nations, so the writings of Plato have preoccupied
<i>every school of learning, every lover of
thought, every church, every poet</i>,—making it
impossible to think, <i>on certain levels, except
through him</i>. He stands between the truth
and every man’s mind, and has almost impressed
language and the primary forms of
thought with his name and seal.... Here is
the germ of that Europe we know so well, in
its long history of arts and arms; here are all
its traits, already discernible in the mind of
Plato.... How Plato came thus to be Europe,
and philosophy, and almost literature, is the problem
for us to solve.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>One ceases to wonder that, surrounded as was
the Corinthian church by <i>this philosophy</i> and in
daily touch with these ideas which have swayed
the world, Paul wrote to it against accepting the
philosophy of men in place of that divine philosophy
which he and other apostles were preaching
through the cross of Christ. “When I came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
you, brethren,” writes the apostle, “I came not
proclaiming the testimony of God with <i>grand reasoning
or philosophies</i>, for I decided to know
nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and He
was crucified.... And my thought and my statement
was not clothed in captivating <i>philosophical
reasons</i>; but, in demonstrated spirit and power, so
<i>that your trust might not be in human philosophy</i>,
but in Divine power.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> “Beware lest any man
spoil you <i>through philosophy</i> and vain deceit, after
the tradition of men, after the elements [margin]
of the world, and not after Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution
the basis
of Platonism.</div>

<p>Seeing, then, that the Platonic system of
education has exerted, and is still exerting,
such an influence over the minds
of men, it behooves us to ascertain the
basic principles of his system. What did the man
believe, and what did he teach? Quotations have
already been given showing that he is the father of
<i>modern philosophy</i>. Emerson defines this philosophy.
He says: “<i>Philosophy is the account which
the human mind gives to itself of the constitution
of the world.</i>” All attempts, then, to account for
the constitution of the world when a “thus saith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the Lord,” is refused, is philosophy. And philosophy
is Plato.</p>

<p>“Through faith we understand that the worlds
were framed by the word of God, so that things
which are seen were not made of things which do
appear.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But Platonism is the <i>mind</i> trying to
account to itself for the constitution of the worlds.
How, think you, did the author of this philosophy
go about to account for things which can be
grasped by <i>faith alone</i>? “To Plato belongs the
honor of first subjecting education to a scientific
examination,” says Painter. Here began the laboratory
studies which have been continued by
Huxley, Darwin, and others. And thus from
Plato Europe and America have gained their ideas
of evolution. Plato brought these ideas from
Egypt and Babylon, and the schools of to-day
follow this man-made philosophy. Our men of
intellect write text-books which they place in the
hands of youth, teaching them to account for the
constitution of the worlds according to the reasoning
of men’s minds.</p>

<p>A few more thoughts concerning Plato, and we
shall see what evolution is, and where it is now
found. Aristotle, the illustrious pupil of Plato,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“created the science of logic,” “the science of
<i>exact</i> reasoning,” as Webster puts it. Says Emerson:
“The balanced soul came.” “His daring
imagination gives him the more solid grasp of
facts.... According to the old sentence, ‘If
Jove should descend to the earth, <i>he would speak
in the style of Plato</i>.’” This last, the Christian
can readily believe; but the Son of man used an
entirely different speech, although Plato antedates
his birth over four hundred years, and was, at the
time of the advent of Christ, the ruler of the
intellectual world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Platonism
in modern
schools</div>

<p>“In reading logarithms, one is not more secure
than following Plato in his flights.” Plato himself
is given credit for saying: “There is a science
of sciences—I call it Dialectic—<i>which is</i> the
<i>intellect discriminating the false and the true</i>.”
There is indeed a science of sciences—the science
of salvation. There is verily a way of judging
between the false and the true, for the Spirit of
truth will guide you into all truth. But the human
brain can never do this. It was this same logic,
Plato’s “science of sciences,” which was given
such prominence in the papal schools and all
medieval education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Here stand the two systems side by side,
the one guided by human reason, the
other by the Spirit of the living God.
Remember that the world bows to Plato;
and, raising its hands in an attitude of worship,
lays at his feet its tribute, its dearest idol,—its
educational system. Chambers’s Encyclopedia,
art. “Plato,” shows conclusively that this Greek
philosopher holds still his exalted position in literary
circles and among educators. It says: “Since
the French Revolution particularly, the study of
Plato has been pursued with renewed vigor in Germany,
France, and England; and many of our
distinguished authors, without expressly professing
Platonism,—as Coleridge, Wordsworth, Mrs.
Browning, Ruskin, etc.,—have formed a strong
and growing party of adherents, who <i>could find no
common banner under which they could at once so
conveniently and so honorably muster as that of
Plato</i>.”</p>

<p>Christians are to be gathered under the ensign
of Christ;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> but many educators of to-day find “no
common banner under which they could so conveniently
and so honorably muster as that of
Plato.” Christianity or paganism, which shall it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
be in the education of Protestant children of to-day?
How did it happen that the ideas of Plato
were so generally accepted throughout Europe?
The article in Chambers’s Encyclopedia, from
which the foregoing quotation is made, tells in the
following words how the early Christian church
became contaminated by the teachings of Plato:
“The works of Plato were extensively <i>studied by
the Church Fathers</i>, one of whom joyfully recognizes,
in the great teacher of the academy, the
schoolmaster who, in the fullness of time, was
destined to educate the heathen for Christ, as
Moses did the Jews.” If the early church adopted
the educational system of Plato, one does not
wonder that by the Middle Ages Europe was
ready for Greek philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Platonism
in Europe
and
America</div>

<p>In the year 1453, the Turks captured
Constantinople, and “many Greek scholars
took refuge in Italy. The times
were propitious for them.” Let it be
remembered that this was one of the mileposts in
the history of the Dark Ages. The Latin tongue
had been the universal language during the days of
papal supremacy. There was an uprising against
the tyranny of the papacy over thought, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
modern tongues began to appear. In order to
stem the tide without losing ground, the papacy
turned the attention of men’s minds to Greek
classics rather than to the Bible of Wyclif or
Erasmus, and a little later to the writings of
Luther. Indeed, for the papacy the “times were
propitious.”</p>

<p>“Noble and wealthy patronage was not lacking,
and under its fostering care they (the Greeks)
became for a time the teachers of Europe. <i>They
succeeded in kindling a remarkable enthusiasm for
antiquity.</i> Manuscripts were collected, translations
were made, <i>academies were established</i>, and
libraries were founded. Several of the popes
became generous patrons of ancient learning....
Eager scholars from England, France, and Germany
sat at the feet of Italian masters, in order
afterward to bear beyond the Alps the precious
seed of the new culture.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Painter further gives
the effects of this spread of Greek classics: “In
Italy it tended strongly to <i>paganize</i> its adherents.
Ardor for antiquity became at last intoxication.
Infidelity prevailed in the highest ranks of the
church; Christianity was despised as a superstition;
immorality abounded in the most shameful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
forms. The heathenism of Athens was revived in
Christian Rome.” And scholars from England,
France, and Germany sat at the feet of these
heathen teachers, drinking in their philosophy, and
then hastening across the Alps to propagate these
ideas in the schools for the education of the young.
This was the influence against which the Reformation
had to fight. It is from Oxford, Cambridge,
and the universities of Germany and France that
American colleges and universities have imbibed
these same pagan ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of
the classics</div>

<p>The classics form the backbone of paganism,
as <i>the Bible forms the basis of
Christian education</i>. The classics are
enduring, because they are the highest product of
the human mind. The recent move in educational
circles, and on the part of some of our leading
colleges against the study of the “humanities”
(the Greek and Latin classics), and in favor of the
study of “moderns” (that is, science, modern languages,
and history), can never reach a point of
stability until the Bible is put in its proper position
as an educational factor, for to push out the classics
without putting in their place that which is
equally as strong, <i>if not stronger</i>, is useless. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
reaction is inevitable, and the classics will be
returned to their old-time place of honor. Christian
education in its simplicity is the only alternative.</p>

<p>This does not mean the substitution of a class in
Bible or sacred history for the former classics. As
the classic literature has been the basis of all
instruction in our schools since the Middle Ages, a
reformation necessitates a decided breaking down
of the old system, and the adoption of a new system
built upon an entirely different foundation,—a
system in which the Word of God shall be the
basis of all education, and the text-book in every
line of study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paganism
and our
children</div>

<p>Parents, reading this, may say that but
a small proportion of the people ever
obtain a classical education. But if you
send your child only to the modern kindergarten,
he is there told the story of Pluto; or of
Ceres, goddess of the golden grain; Mercury, the
winged messenger god; the wood nymphs; Æolus,
who rules the winds and brings the storms; or
Apollo, who is driven across the heavens in a chariot
of fire. Or, if the real Greek names are
dropped, <i>nature is personified</i> in such a way as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
give the childish mind a distorted idea of things
which leads to anything but the pure and simple
truth of God’s Word. He thus drinks in the myths
and fables of the Greeks from very infancy. One
of his First Readers has the story of Proserpina,
who was stolen, and hidden under the earth for a
season. Nature-studies are often made attractive
to youthful minds by being associated with the
ancient Greek gods and goddesses. But even in
a more subtle way the ideas of classic lore are
taught in the evolutionary theories of science and
philosophy, through primary, grammar, and high-school
grades.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution</div>

<p>“Philosophy,” as before quoted, is defined
to be “the account which the
human mind gives to itself of the constitution of
the world.” That philosophy is now termed <i>evolution</i>,
for evolution is man’s way of accounting for
the constitution of the world, and the creatures
which inhabit it. Take notice of these words from
the pen of Henry Drummond. In a paper prepared
for the Parliament of Religions, entitled
“Evolution of Christianity,” he says: “Working
in its own field, science made the discovery of <i>how
God made the world</i>.” “Through faith <i>we</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God,” writes Paul to the Hebrews.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Drummond continues: “To science itself
this discovery was startling and as unexpected as
it has ever been to theology. Exactly fifty years
ago Mr. Darwin wrote in dismay to Mr. Hooker
that the old theory of <i>specific creation</i>—that God
made all species apart, and introduced them into
the world one by one—was melting away before
his eyes. He unburdened the thought, as he says
in his letter, almost as if he were confessing a murder.
But <i>so entirely has the world bowed to
the weight of facts before which</i> even Darwin
trembled, that one of the last books on Darwinism
by so religious a mind as that of Mr. Alfred
Russell Wallace, contains in its opening chapter
these words: ‘The whole scientific and literary
world, <i>even the whole educated public, accepts as a
matter of common knowledge the origin of the
species from the other allied</i> species, by the ordinary
process of natural birth. <i>The idea of special
creation, or any other exceptional mode of production,
is absolutely extinct.</i>’”</p>

<p>It would be well if each could read the words
of Drummond for himself; but in brief he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“It is needless at this time of day to point out
the surpassing grandeur of the new conception
[evolution]. How it has filled the Christian imagination
and kindled to enthusiasm the soberest
scientific minds from Darwin downward is known
to everyone. For that <i>splendid hypothesis we
can not be too grateful to science</i>; and that
theology can only enrich itself which gives it
even temporary place in its doctrine of creation.”</p>

<p>How strange that God failed to make known
this stupendous truth (?) through his Word, and
left it for science in the hands of Plato’s descendants
to figure out! “What it needed,”
says Drummond, “was a credible presentation,
in view especially of astronomy, geology, paleontology,
and biology. These, as we have said,
had made the former theory simply untenable.
<i>And science has supplied theology with a theory
which the intellect can accept.</i>” Faith has been
laid aside. The human intellect has been exalted.
Paganism has cast out Christianity, and our boys
and girls now study the nebular hypothesis, explanatory
of the creation of the worlds, in their
astronomy and geography; they dwell upon the
eons of ages consumed in the formation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
geologic strata of the earth; they study the fossils
of the ages past, and from them describe
the evolution of man from a polyp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools
have greatest
influence</div>

<p>Of what use is the preaching of the
gospel on one day of the week, while
six days out of seven paganism guides
the intellect? Why sit dreaming of
heaven, or spend money to proselyte, while
pagan education leads your own children by the
hand, and weaves about their mind a network of
theories which blinds their eyes to spiritual truths?
There is weight in the words of President Harper,
of Chicago University, who says: “It is difficult
to prophesy what the result of our present method
of educating the youth will be in fifty years. We
are training the mind in our public schools, but
the moral side of the child’s nature is almost
entirely neglected. The Roman Catholic Church
insists on remedying this manifest evil, but our
Protestant churches seem to ignore it completely.
They expect the Sunday-school to make good
what our public schools leave undone, and the
consequence is that we overlook a danger as real
and as great as any we have had to face.”</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CHRIST THE EDUCATOR OF EDUCATORS</span></h2>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Christ Life</span></h3>

<p>To Israel as a nation had been intrusted the
sacred gift of teaching; but the power had departed
from this people because they had mingled
their educational ideas with the heathen, and had
so far forgotten the commands of Jehovah that
they were sending their children to heathen teachers,
inviting into their midst the prophets of Baal.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
That nation whose prophets had more than once
warned the kings of the earth of impending danger,
heard no longer the voice of God. For nearly four
hundred years no prophet had arisen in Israel.
“Prophecy had become so completely extinct—the
Spirit had so utterly departed from Israel—that
it was apparently assumed by many that a
new prophet was an impossibility.” Had the God
who brought their fathers out of Egypt, who had
driven out the nations before their face,—the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,—had He forsaken
His people? Often the question was asked, as the
family circle formed around the table. Almost
with bated breath mothers awaited the birth of a
child, hoping it might be the chosen of God, but
still no prophet came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Israel prior
to birth
of Christ</div>

<p>The priests in Israel went on in their
formal round of duties; yearly the nation
assembled at Jerusalem for the annual
feasts. Thousands of victims were slain,
and the blood ran freely from the altar; but there
was no answering fire, no glow of the Shekinah.
Jewish children sat day after day at the feet
of masters in Israel, listening to the repetition of
tradition and the words of the Talmud; but the
life had departed from the instruction, and there
was no response in the souls of men. Heaven
waited anxiously for the opening of some soul to
the inflow of God’s Spirit, but the avenues through
which it should have come were closed. Teachers
who should have been “under the full control of
the Spirit,” knew not what it was to hear the
voice of God; and children, fed only with physical
and mental food, grew to manhood with shriveled
spiritual natures, to become in turn the teachers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the next generation. As Israel’s governmental prosperity
was due to her educational system, as her
land produced abundantly when the children were
properly taught, and as the nations round them
bowed in respect to the chosen of God so long
as they adhered to the system of education once
offered, it is no wonder that the year 5 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, following
centuries of departure from these truths,
found Palestine in the iron grasp of Rome, and its
people scarce able to pay the necessary tribute.
Heaven’s eye saw this and more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John the
Baptist</div>

<p>Among the priests who ministered in the
temple was one who looked for a deliverer,
and to him the angel Gabriel came
with the words: “Thy prayer is heard; and thy
wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou
shalt call his name John.” Although this man had
touched the chord on which angels sang, and was
enabled to feel the pulse-beat of the Eternal, the
angel’s words startled him, and he believed them
not. And that the sounds of earth might for a
time be shut out, and Zacharias be enabled to
listen only to the voice of God, the angel laid his
hand upon him, and he remained speechless until
the day of the fulfillment of Gabriel’s words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The education
of
the forerunner</div>

<p>A prophet was born who was to turn
the hearts of Israel to their God. He
came in the spirit and power of Elias,
preaching repentance. His life was one
of loneliness and poverty. His time was spent
away from the cities and multitudes; for Jerusalem,
the appointed leader of nations, no longer
offered an education fitted for her own prophets.
And so God trained John. Of those born of
women there is none greater than John the
Baptist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesus of
Nazareth</div>

<p>Once more heaven and earth were linked.
How small the chain! Only, as it were,
the size of a thread, and the connecting
link was the heart of a woman! But in the town
of Nazareth, the lowly and the despised, lived a
young woman, betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter of
Galilee. Looking into the future, little more than
dreaming of life and its hopes, she lifted her eyes,
and beheld an angel. The soul longing to be in
tune with God, brings angelic hosts to earth. If
that yearning be but a mother’s longing, heaven
bows a listening ear; the throb is felt throughout
creation. So close is God to man! The words,
“Hail, highly favored, the Lord is with thee,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
startled Mary, for she had not expected such a
quick response. She was troubled, but the angel
said, “Fear not, Mary.” “The power of the
Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that
holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be
called the <span class="smcap">Son of God</span>.” “The fullness of time
had come.” God, having waited years for Israel
to return to Him, now accomplished the master
stroke of the Godhead. Creation wondered.</p>

<p>The Spirit overshadowed Mary; it thrilled her
nerves, and touched to life the germ of a new
being. To humanity was given the power to form
a body for the indwelling of the God of heaven.
“A body hast Thou prepared Me.” The treasure
was in an earthen vessel, that the more glory
might abound to God. “Christ set up His tabernacle
in the midst of our human encampment.
He pitched His tent by the side of the tents of
men, that He might dwell among us, and make us
familiar with His divine character and life.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Education
of
Christ</div>

<p>The early years of the Christ child found
Him sitting <i>at His mother’s knee</i>. From
her lips and from the <i>scrolls of the
prophets</i>, He learned of heavenly things!
<i>Nature</i> was His unwearied teacher; from her He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
gathered stores of scientific knowledge. He studied
the life of plants and animals, and the life
of man. “The parables by which, during His
ministry, He loved to teach His lessons of truth,
show how open His spirit was to the influences of
nature, and how He had gathered the spiritual
teaching from the surroundings of His daily life.”
“As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks,” so
panted His soul for spiritual intercourse with the
Father; and that longing which led Him to listen
attentively for the voice of God in nature, developed
the highest powers of His mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spiritual
first
in Christ’s
education</div>

<p>His was not a sudden growth, but gradual,
as with other children; and while
developing a strong physical body, “the
child grew, and waxed strong in spirit,
filled with wisdom.” The secret of the difference
between Jesus and His companions is revealed in
this verse. Most children develop mentally and
physically, especially during their first twelve years;
but the spiritual nature of Christ was the leading
one and in His threefold nature the mental and
physical were always well balanced by the spiritual.
As Hinsdale says: “The divine mind, the
human heart, and nature are closely united” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Him. <i>He did not seek instruction in the rabbinical
schools, for they had lost the spirit which
to him was life.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ
recognized
his
life work</div>

<p>At an early age, probably not later than
twelve, He recognized His life work, and
henceforth every energy was bent in one
direction. His lot was to reveal the
divinity of God, to show the possibilities of the
God-man, to prove to the world that it is possible
for God and man to unite and for the spiritual
nature to rule; and proving this, to show that the
heavenly instituted system of education was not a
failure, although at that time it was in disrepute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ
chose the
spiritual
plane</div>

<p>The age of twelve was a critical period
in the life of a Jewish child, for it was
then that the physical nature was approaching
maturity. The next few years
meant much to the youth, for he then had it within
his power to choose for life the plane upon which
he expected to live. If physical strength and the
gratification of the natural senses are the height
of ambition, by yielding to temptations of this
nature at about this age the life-habits are fixed.
Perhaps in other countries the development is
somewhat slower, owing to climatic influences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
but from twelve to sixteen every youth struggles
against tendencies and ambitions which a few
years later cease to be temptations. It was so
with Christ; but as He stood watching the paschal
services at the time of His first visit to the temple,
“day by day He saw their meaning more clearly.
Every act seemed to be bound up with His own
life. New impulses were awakening within Him.”
For years, that service, established to appeal to the
spiritual nature, had degenerated into the mere
slaying of beasts. For the first time a <i>soul</i> was
touched, and heavenly impulses were awakened.
It was then that the temptation to pass a life in
physical ease was met and overcome. Heaven
seemed to open to the child’s eyes, and He heard
the call of God to a life with Him. He sought
to be alone, and in the silence His heart caught
the vibrations of heavenly beings, and the grosser
physical nature was abandoned forever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ and
the rabbis</div>

<p>The resolve formed, a new light and
power seemed to take possession of His
mind, and entering the school conducted
in the temple, He listened eagerly to hear
from the lips of the rabbis some spiritual lesson.
“The doctors turned upon Him with questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and they were amazed at His answers.” He manifested
such deep piety, and His questions opened
to the minds of His listeners such depths of truth,
that wonder filled their minds. A harp swept by
heavenly zephyrs was before them, and the music
fell on untrained ears. <i>The first work of the
heaven-sent teacher had begun.</i> “Wist ye not
that I must be about My Father’s business?” He
asked, as Joseph and Mary met Him at the temple
gate. They saw Him with physical eyes, and
thought Him all their own; but the eye of the child
had pierced the cloud which hung between heaven
and earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manual
training
in Christ’s
life</div>

<p>From Jerusalem He returned with His
parents, and aided them in their life of
toil. “He hid in His own heart the mystery
of His mission, waiting submissively
for the appointed time for Him to enter upon His
work.” Those eighteen years were years of toil
and study. Each day drew Him nearer to the
time when a voice from heaven should proclaim
Him a divine teacher. He was not impatient, but
as a carpenter did thorough work; as a son, He
was obedient; and as a subject, He was law-abiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The age
of strongest
spirituality</div>

<p>He never lost sight of the fact that He
had a mission, and that it took a spiritual
life to fulfill that mission. He was
tempted in all points, and suffered in the
temptation; but each resistance was a round added
in the ladder He was building toward heaven.
There was a law in Israel calling the priests to
their sacred office at the age of thirty. This
statute was based upon a law of human nature.
The allotted time of man’s life is divided into two
portions. The first forty years is a time of
growth, the last thirty a period of decline. Of
the first half we have the age of physical development,
then a time when the intellectual powers
are in the ascendency, and from twenty-five to
thirty or thirty-five is the time of special development
in the spiritual nature. Every man has three
chances in life; and the choice made, whether
for worldly honor, for intellectual powers, or a life
of faith, <i>depends wholly upon the object constantly
kept before the child by its educators</i>. Had Christ
been under the influence of the teachers of His
day, the probability is that He would have chosen
to live either on the physical or the intellectual
plane, for this was the choice made by all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pupils of those schools, but His early training by
Mary, who, as a mother, had yielded herself as the
“handmaid of the Lord,” and His close communion
with God through the works of nature,
guided Him into right channels, and at the auspicious
moment He voluntarily offered Himself to
His Father to fulfill the mission which it lay in His
power to reject. Of His later struggles the record
is silent. There came a period, however,
when He might have posed as an intellectual
leader, but His earlier decision led Him to pass
this temptation unsullied. To prove this true, we
need only to study the nature of the temptations
presented in the wilderness. That He remained
true to His mission is due to early training. This
will not be controverted, for it is a divine law seen
everywhere in nature.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Ministry of the God-man.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Jesus as
a teacher</div>

<p>One of the gifts of the Spirit is that of
teaching, and Christ was a born teacher.
Acquired ability amounts to but little
where the spirit of teaching is wanting. Christ
was a teacher both by virtue of His nationality,
since all Jews were called to be teachers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
also by direct appointment; for He had to accomplish
in His own life what the nation had refused
to accomplish. He carried with Him no credentials,
no statement of scholarship signed by the
doctors of Israel, for none of these schools had
known Him as a pupil; yet Nicodemus, a master
teacher in Jerusalem, after listening to His words,
sought Him in the quiet evening hours, and addressed
Him as <i>Rabbi</i>,—<span class="smcap">Teacher</span>. In the course
of the conversation this learned man said, “We
know that thou art a divine teacher, for no man
can do as Thou except God be with him.” It was
as a teacher, and more, as a divine teacher, that
He was known from the very beginning of His
ministry. His ministry was a ministry of <i>teaching</i>.
He was known as a teacher, not so much
by the words He spoke as by the <i>life He lived</i>,
and the works He did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As a
teacher,
success
depended
upon the
life</div>

<p>The words of Bushnell are true: “We
can see for ourselves in the simple
directions and freedom of His teachings,
that whatever He advances is
from Himself.” He was giving Himself,
and that He had a self, a divine
self, to give is <i>due to the education of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
child and youth</i>. God’s image was perfect in
Him, and when the time of ministry came, there
shone from Him what previous years had been
developing in Him. <span class="smcap">This is the object of
Christian education.</span> The same author further
says: “He is the high-priest ... of the divine
nature, speaking as one that has come out from
God, and <i>has nothing to borrow from the world</i>.
It is not to be detected ... that the <i>human
sphere in which He moved imparted anything
to Him</i>. His teachings are just as full of
<i>divine nature</i>, as Shakespeare’s of human.”
What a commentary on the two systems of education,
the one choosing <i>inspiration</i> as a basis;
the other, the product of the human brain!</p>

<div class="sidenote">He taught
as one
having
authority</div>

<p>Bushnell continues: “In His teaching
He does not speculate about God, as
a school professor, drawing out conclusions
by a practice on words, and
deeming that the way of proof; He does not
build up a frame of evidence from below, by
some constructive process, such as the philosophers
delight in; but He simply speaks of God
and spiritual things as one who has come out
from Him, <i>to tell us what He knows</i>. And His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
simple telling brings us the reality; proves it to
us in its own sublime self-evidence; awakens
even the consciousness of it in our own bosom;
so that formal arguments or dialectic proofs
<i>offend us by their coldness</i>, and seem, in fact,
to be only opaque substances set between us
and the light. Indeed, He makes even the
world luminous by His words—fills it with an
immediate and new sense of God, which nothing
has ever been able to expel. The incense
of the upper world is brought out in His garments,
and flows abroad, as perfume, on the
poisoned air.” And no wonder, for from a child
He had breathed the atmosphere of heaven.
<i>Every child should have the same privilege.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Principles
of Christ’s
education</div>

<p>When the two teachers, Christ and
Nicodemus, the representatives of two
systems of education, the divine and
the worldly, met, Christ outlined to
his questioner the principles upon which His
system was based:<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>—</p>

<p>1. Its primary object is to prepare its pupils for
the kingdom of God, a spiritual kingdom.</p>

<p>2. The first step is a spiritual birth; for “God
is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
worship in spirit.” “That which is born of the
flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit.”</p>

<p>3. This the natural man can not understand, for
it is spiritually discerned. As well might I try to
explain it to you, Nicodemus, as to explain the
blowing of the winds; you can see the results, but
the truth can not be grasped by the senses. Do
you pose as a teacher in Israel, and know not
these things? “If I have told you earthly things,
and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell
you of heavenly things?” I have but begun to tell
you of the plan of the Father. There are yet
many things, “but ye can not bear them now.”</p>

<p>4. The things I teach are as light in the darkness.
“Every one that doeth evil hateth the
light, ... but he that doeth truth cometh to the
light.” It is thus that I distinguish true scholars
from the false. When truth is offered, some
believe, and whosoever believes in the Son of man
shall have eternal life.</p>

<p>Nicodemus said: “How <i>can</i> these things be?”
He longed for proof, for demonstration. “<i>Proof</i>
is indeed the method of science, including theology;
it has, no doubt, a function in religious teaching;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but <i>it is not the method of the highest form of
religious teaching</i>. The fundamental truths of
religion are directly revealed to the human consciousness,
and are not argued out or logically established....
<i>The greatest religious truths lie
deeper than formal reasoning.</i> This is the reason
why the <i>greatest religious teachers have worked
below the proposition-and-proof level</i>; as said
before, they have something of the prophetic gift.
It may be added that no preacher [or teacher] who
works mainly on this line will attract the most
religious minds; he will not attract even those who
have the piety of the intellect, to say nothing of
the piety of the affections and the will. He may
develop logical acumen, critical ability, and controversial
power, but he will prove unequal to the
generation of spirituality.... Such a minister
will be sure to lead his flock into the error that is
now far too common,—of assigning a disproportionate
place in religious faith and life to the understanding,
to the partial exclusion of the heart.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His pupils</div>

<p>His actual work as a teacher is seen in
His dealings, first, with the apostles,
His immediate followers, who were in training that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
they in turn might become teachers; second, with
the multitudes who thronged His way; third, with
the children who were brought to Him by mothers,
and who were taught by Him, that mothers and
apostles might the better know how to deal with
youthful minds. Primarily, His was a training-school
for workers, and His pupils represented
every phase of human disposition. He chose
humble fishermen, because their minds were unprejudiced,
and they had less to unlearn before accepting
the truth. “He knew what was in man.”
That is, He had insight into the minds and hearts,
and knew just what was needed to awaken the
soul-life of each student. This is a necessary gift
in the successful teacher. How much that is
now taught would be dispensed with if teachers
could read the soul conditions of pupils, and then
feed them with only such food as would nourish.
<i>This, too, is Christian education.</i> Before the
teacher can have such an experience, however, he
must have soul culture, and be in such close touch
with the fountain of truth that he can draw whatever
is needed. The well is deep, <i>and faith alone
can bring the water of life to the surface</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His schoolroom
the
country.</div>

<p>With His chosen apostles, Christ “<i>withdrew
from the confusion of the city
to the quiet of the fields and hills</i> as
more in harmony with the lessons of
self-abnegation he desired to teach them....
Here, surrounded by the works of his own creation,
he could turn the thoughts of his hearers
<i>from the artificial to the natural</i>.” Those
schools to-day which are located in some quiet
country place afford the best opportunities for
education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Text-books</div>

<p>The books used seem to be two, and
only two: <i>the writings of the prophets</i>
and <i>the great book of nature</i>. Hinsdale
says: “Scripture furnishes the basis of His
teaching.... It is impossible to say how many
distinct recognitions of Scripture are found in His
teachings, but the number and range are both
large.... One of the most interesting of these
[methods] is his constant habit of expanding
Scripture, or, as we might say, of reading into
it new meanings. He thus treats not merely
prophetic passages, but also dogmatic passages;
moreover, His meanings are sometimes new, not
merely to the Jewish teachers, but also to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
authors of the passages themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This was
because the teacher was led by the Spirit of
truth, which guides into all truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His system
emphasized
the
practical</div>

<p>It must be remembered that this instruction
was given to men of mature
minds, and tended to fit them to become
teachers of all men in whatever
station. Probably none of the apostles were
under thirty. They were men who had become
settled in a life work. John, the youngest, was
most susceptible to spiritual teaching, and at
length developed this nature so fully that his
spirit left his body in vision.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Painter expresses
well the method of instruction followed by Christ.
He says: “He observes the order of nature, and
seeks only a gradual development,—‘first the
blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in
the ear.’ With His disciples, He insists chiefly
upon the <i>practical</i> and <i>fundamental</i> truths of
religion, <i>building</i>, as it were, a substantial framework
in the beginning, which the Holy Spirit
was to conduct afterward to a harmonious and
beautiful completion.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Visible results
of
His teaching</div>

<p>It was thus that all the truths we
call doctrines were taught. The lesson
on the resurrection was at the
tomb of Lazarus; the one on Sabbath
observance was in the synagogue, healing the
withered hand, or bidding the dumb to speak.
“One finds in His program,” says a French
writer, “neither literary studies nor course of
theology. And yet, strange as it may seem, when
the moment of action arrives, the disciples—those
unlettered fishermen—have become orators that
move the multitudes and confound the doctors;
profound thinkers that have sounded the Scriptures
and the human heart; writers that give to
the world immortal books in a language not their
mother tongue.” If the worth of a system of education
is to be judged by results, the world
must hold its peace when looking upon the work
of Christ. Astonishment will again take hold of
men when Christians return to His methods. Of
His reference to nature we have no need to
write, for His parables are the wonder of the
ages, and take a unique position in the literature
of all times. Christ was not, as many other
teachers, a writer of books. His writing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on the hearts of men. He spoke, and the
vibratory waves set in motion have continued
until to-day, and still beat upon our hearts. The
soul of the spiritually minded hears, and men
to-day become pupils of the Man of Nazareth
as verily as did Peter, James, and John.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indications
of a completed
course</div>

<p>A student was ready to go forth from
Christ’s teachings to open the truth to
others only when he could say, “Lo,
now speakest Thou plainly.... Now
we are sure that Thou knowest all things, and
needest not that any man should ask Thee. By
this we believe that Thou camest forth from
God.”<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> With the multitudes He did a work
similar to that with the disciples; but because
they were coming and going, He could not do
the same thorough work. His teaching, however,
was <i>always practical</i>, and the farmer went
to his field a better man, seeing God in the
growing grain; the fisherman returned to his nets
with the thought ringing in his mind that he
should be a fisher of men; the mother returned
to her home recognizing her children as younger
members of God’s family, and with a strong desire
to teach as He taught. The tendency always in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
all His teaching was to arouse thought, to awaken
soul-longings, and cause hearts to beat with a new
life fed from above. Standing between heaven
and earth of the musical scale, His life vibrated
in unison with those higher notes of the universes
circling round His Father’s throne, and with His
human arm He encircled the world, imparting to
beings here the same life, striving always to bring
them into tune with the Infinite. “I, if I be
lifted up,” He said, “will draw all men unto
Me.”</p>

<span class="smaller">EDUCATION IN THE EARLY CHURCH</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The church
to teach
all nations</div>

<p>“I pray not that Thou shouldest take
them out of the world, but that Thou
shouldest keep them from the evil.
They are not of the world, even as I
am not of the world. Sanctify [teach] them
through Thy truth.”<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> As He lifted His eyes to
heaven in those moments of quiet, just before
entering Gethsemane, these words fell from the
lips of the Son of man. Looking upon the little
company of men clustering around Him, He saw
in them the nucleus of the church which was to
be called by His name, and His heart yearned for
that body of Christians. Many and fierce would
be their struggles; for He had breathed into the
hearts of men a system of instruction which, because
it was truth, would awaken all the bitterness
of the enemy of truth; and the new system must be
able to resist all the darts which human minds,
swayed by the prince of evil, could hurl. <i>Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
philosophy must meet and vanquish human philosophy</i>.
That was now the controversy, and it
was left to a few weak men to start the work.
What power was in that Spirit of truth with which
they were baptized! His commission to this same
company, as they watched Him recede from earth
on the day of His ascension, was, “Go ye therefore,
and <i>teach</i> all nations.” They, the true
Israel, were now to become teachers of nations.</p>

<p>Recognizing the difficulties to be met, He had,
on another occasion, said: “I send you forth as
sheep among wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents,
and simple as doves.” In no boasted philosophy,
no high-sounding words, but in <i>simplicity
of truth, was to lie their strength</i>. Of the
works of the apostles and those who believed on
Christ through their teaching, we have this divine
testimony, “I know thy works, and thy labor, and
thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them
which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say
they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
them liars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and
for my name’s sake hast labored and hast not
fainted.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It is therefore evident that a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
work was done, and that very speedily; for again
Inspiration describes it: “Behold a white horse:
and he that sat on him had a bow; ... and he
went forth conquering, and to conquer.”<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Men,
though admonished to be as harmless as doves,
were nevertheless, when teachers of truth, enabled
to make themselves felt in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A call from
popular
education</div>

<p>To accept Christianity in those early
days meant the withdrawal from everything
before cherished; it meant not only
the separation from heathenism in worship,
or Babylon, but also <i>from heathenism in
thought</i> and education, or <i>Egypt</i>. It was a second
exodus. Justin Martyr, a Christian born near the
close of the first century, is quoted by Painter, as
he describes the life of a follower of Christ: “We
who once delighted in lewdness now embrace chastity;
we who once embraced magical arts, have
consecrated ourselves to the good and unbegotten
God; we who loved above all things the gain of
money and possessions, now bring all that we have
into one common stock, and give a portion to
everyone that needs; we who once hated and
killed one another, now pray for our enemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>With this spirit in the church we are not surprised
to find that in the words of Coleman, “<i>The
tender solicitude of these early Christians for the
religious instruction of their children is one of
their most beautiful characteristics.</i> They taught
them, even at the earliest dawn of intelligence,
the sacred names of God and the Saviour. They
sought to lead the infant minds of their children
up to God, by familiar narratives from Scripture,
of Joseph, of young Samuel, of Josiah, and of the
holy child Jesus. The history of the patriarchs
and prophets, apostles, and men whose lives are
narrated in the sacred volume, <i>were the nursery
tales</i> with which they sought to form the tender
minds of their children. As the mind of the child
expanded, the parents made it their sacred duty
and delightful task daily to exercise him in the
recital of select passages of scripture relating to the
doctrines and duties of religion. The Bible was
the entertainment of the fireside. It <i>was the first,
the last, the only schoolbook almost, of the child</i>;
and sacred psalmody, the only song with which
his infant cry was hushed as he was lulled to rest
on his mother’s arm. The sacred song and the
rude melody of its music were, from the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
periods of Christian antiquity, an important means
of impressing the infant heart with sentiments of
piety, and of imbuing the susceptible minds of the
young with the knowledge and the faith of the
Scriptures.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">True
education
developed
missionaries</div>

<p>Painter writes: “The purpose of these
early Christian parents, as of the ancient
Jews, was to train up their children in
the fear of God. In order that the children
might be exposed as little as
possible to the corrupting influence of heathen
associations, <i>their education was conducted within
the healthful precincts of home</i>. AS A RESULT,
they grew up without a taste for debasing pleasures;
they acquired simple domestic tastes; and
when the time came, they took their place as
consistent and earnest workers in the church.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
These words make several facts very prominent:—</p>

<p><i>1.</i> <i>Christian education should begin in the
home.</i></p>

<p><i>2.</i> <i>Bible stories should be the basis for nursery
tales and infant songs.</i></p>

<p><i>3.</i> <i>Christians should carry out the plan of education
which the Jews failed to obey, and which
Christ revealed in a new light.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p><i>4.</i> <i>The results of such Christian education in
the home school will be elevated characters and
workers in the cause of God.</i></p>

<p>Would that it could be said of Christian mothers
to-day, as a heathen orator once exclaimed concerning
those early followers of Christ, “What
wives these Christians have!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duty
of parents</div>

<p>One of the early Fathers thus expresses
the danger of children and youth in the
schools of the world, and shows the
character of the education needed: “Mothers
ought to care for the bodies of their children, but
it is necessary also that they inspire their offspring
with love for the good and with fear toward God.
And fathers will not limit themselves to giving
their children an earthly vocation, but will interest
themselves also in their heavenly calling.</p>

<p>“The most beautiful heritage that can be given
children is to teach them to govern their passions....
Let us have for our children the same fear
that we have for our houses, when servants go
with a light into places where there is inflammable
material, as hay or straw. They should not be
permitted to go where the fire of impurity may be
kindled in their hearts, and do them an irreparable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
injury. <span class="smcap">A knowledge of the Scriptures is an
antidote against the unreasonable inclinations
of youth and against the reading of
pagan authors</span>, in which heroes, the slaves of
every passion, are lauded. <i>The lessons of the
Bible are springs that water the soul.</i> As our
children are everywhere surrounded by bad examples,
the monastic schools [what would correspond
to-day with church schools] are the best for their
education. <i>Bad habits once contracted, they can
not be got rid of.</i> This is the reason God conducted
Israel into the wilderness, ... that the
vices of the Egyptians might be unlearned....
Now our children are surrounded by vice in our
cities and are unable there to resist bad examples....
<i>Let us take care of the souls of our children</i>,
that they may be formed for virtue, and not be
degraded by vice.”</p>

<p>This writer might well address a modern audience,
for he recognizes the influence of pagan
authors, and states that the Bible alone can counteract
this influence; <i>he recognizes the worldly
schools as Egypt</i>, and says that Christians should
take their children out; and finally he recognizes
the value of having schools located in the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and advises people to move out of the cities with
their children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Church
schools
among
early
Christians</div>

<p>Mosheim says: “There can be no doubt
but that the children of Christians were
carefully trained up from their infancy,
and were early put to reading the sacred
books and learning the principles of religion.
For this purpose <i>schools</i> were erected
everywhere from the beginning.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Training
schools for
missionaries</div>

<p>From these schools for children, we
must distinguish those <i>seminaries</i> of the
early Christians, erected extensively in
the larger cities, at which adults, and
especially <i>such as aspired to be public teachers</i>,
were instructed and educated in all branches of
learning, both human and divine. Such seminaries,
in which young men devoted to the sacred
office were taught whatever was necessary to qualify
them properly for it, the apostles of Christ
undoubtedly both set up themselves, and directed
others to set up.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> St. John, at Ephesus, and Polycarp,
at Smyrna, established such schools. Among
these seminaries, in subsequent times, none was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
more celebrated than that at Alexandria; which
is commonly called a catechetic school.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In
addition, then, to home and church schools for
children, the early Christian church established
seminaries for the education of workers. In reading
the history of the times the course of instruction
is seen to adhere closely to the Scriptures,
and to draw a sharp distinction between the science
of salvation and the Greek and Oriental philosophy
as taught in the pagan schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pagans
feared
Christian
schools</div>

<p>Christian education was often regarded
as narrow and limited by those who
loved to study the mysteries of Greek
wisdom; but as long as they adhered to
their simple studies, and made faith the basis of
their work, there was a power in the truths taught
by the students of these schools, which made the
pagan world, with all its great men, tremble. It
is an interesting fact that as late as the fourth
century, after the Christian schools had lost much
of their power through the mingling of pagan with
Christian methods, and the adoption of some of
the pagan studies, they were still regarded as the
stronghold of Christianity. When Julian, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
apostate, began to reign, an attempt was made to
revive paganism throughout the Roman Empire.
One of his first acts was to <i>close the schools of the
Christians</i>. “He contemptuously observes,” says
Gibbon, “that the men who exalt the merit of
implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the
advantages of science; and he vainly contends that
if they refuse to adore the gods of Homer and
Demosthenes, they ought to content themselves
with expounding Luke and Matthew in the church
of the Galileans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The public
schools of
Julian</div>

<p>“In all the cities of the Roman world,
the education of the youth was intrusted
to masters of grammar and rhetoric; who
were <i>elected by the magistrates, maintained
at the public expense</i>, and distinguished
by many lucrative and honorable privileges....
As soon as the resignation of the more obstinate
teachers had established the unrivaled dominion of
the pagan sophists, Julian invited the rising generation
to resort with freedom to the <i>public
schools</i>, in a just confidence that their tender
minds would receive the impressions of <i>literature
and idolatry</i>. <span class="smcap">If the greatest part of the
Christian youth should be deterred by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
own scruples, or by those of their parents,
from accepting this dangerous mode of instruction,
they must, at the same time, relinquish
the benefits of a liberal education.</span>
Julian had reason to expect that, in the space
of a few years, the church would relapse into its
primeval simplicity, and that the theologians, who
possessed an adequate share of the learning and
eloquence of the age, would be succeeded by a
generation of blind and ignorant fanatics, incapable
of defending the truth of their own principles,
or of exposing the various follies of polytheism.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Julian can not be counted as a fool; for, wishing
to make the world pagan, he proceeded to do so,
(1) <i>By closing the Christian schools where the
“merit of implicit faith” was taught</i>; (2) <i>By
compelling attendance of the public schools, taught
by pagan teachers</i>, and <span class="smcap">where literature and
idolatry were combined</span>.</p>

<p>As Gibbon says, he had <i>just reason</i> to expect
that in the course of a generation the Christians
thus educated would lose their faith, cease to
oppose paganism, and sink into insignificance. If
a pagan emperor expected this in the fourth century,
is it any wonder that Protestants to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
allowing their children to remain in the public
schools where precisely the same things are taught,
in principle as Julian had his public instructors
teach, should lose power and cease to be <i>Protestants</i>?
From the words of Gibbon one would infer
that in the days of Julian there were parents who
refused to send their children to the public schools;
some children who, “because of their own scruples,”
refused to attend; and some teachers who
ceased to teach rather than teach literature and
idolatry in state schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The seminary
at
Alexandria</div>

<p>Special mention is made of the Alexandrian
school, as it was located in an
Egyptian city to which flocked many
noted pagan scholars. Sad as it may
be to do so, it is yet necessary to see how these
schools, and especially this one at Alexandria, lost
their simplicity as they came in contact with pagan
scholars, and attempted to meet them on
their own grounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexandria
adopts
philosophy
of Plato</div>

<p>Mosheim says: “This philosophy [of
Plato] was adopted by such of the
learned at Alexandria as wished to be
accounted Christians, and <i>yet to retain
the name, garb, and the rank of philosophers</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
In particular, all those who in this century presided
in the schools of the Christians at Alexandria ...
are said to have approved of it. These men were
persuaded that true philosophy, the great and most
salutary gift of God, lay in scattered fragments
among all the sects of philosophers; and therefore
that it was the duty of every wise man, and especially
of a Christian teacher, to collect those fragments
from all quarters, and to use them for
the defense of religion and the confutation of
impiety.”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Result of
adopting
worldly
methods</div>

<p>The lesson so dear to Paul—that the
gospel of Christ is the “power of God
unto salvation”—was lost sight of when
these Christian teachers assumed the
philosopher’s garb, and used the philosopher’s
vocabulary to confute impiety. “I have somewhat
against thee,” writes the divine historian
of this age, “because thou hast left thy first
love. Remember therefore from whence thou art
fallen, and repent, and <i>do the first works</i>; or
else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove
thy candlestick out of his place.”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The heaven-lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
taper of Christian education in its purity was
beginning to grow dim. Its flame must have a
constant supply of truth, or, like the candle without
oxygen, it burns low, and finally goes out.
Paul, writing to the Corinthians who were placed
in circumstances similar to those of the school at
Alexandria, that is, pressed upon all sides by
pagan philosophy, said: “I came toward you
with weakness and fear and great timidity. And
my thought and my statement was not clothed in
captivating philosophical reasons; but in demonstrated
spirit and power, so that your trust might
not <i>be in human philosophy</i>, but in divine power....
What we speak is not in an artificial
discussion of a human philosophy, but by spiritual
teachings, comparing spiritualities with the
spiritual.”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dialectics
versus the
Scriptures</div>

<p>Again, “Dialectic,” or logic, was that
science of which Aristotle, the disciple
of Plato, boasted as being the father.
Says a writer of the church after the
decline was well begun, it “is the queen of arts
and sciences. <i>In it reason dwells</i>, and is manifested
and developed. <i>It is dialectic alone that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
can give knowledge and wisdom;</i> it alone shows
<span class="smcap">what and whence we are, and teaches us
our destiny</span> [human philosophy and evolution];
through it we learn to know good and evil. And
<i>how necessary is it</i> to a clergyman, in order
that he may be able to meet and vanquish
heretics!” Men have more than once reverted
to logic to vanquish heretics, but it was only
when the Spirit of truth was lacking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The educational
question
caused a
division</div>

<p>Error was rapidly creeping into the
church, and it came principally through
these schools, as has already been seen.
However, truth was not abandoned for
error without a struggle. Mosheim says:
“The estimation in which human learning should
be held was a question on which the Christians
were about equally divided. For while many
thought that the literature and writings of the
Greeks ought to receive attention, <i>there were others
who contended that true piety and religion were
endangered by such studies</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> People then, as
now, looked to the leaders in the church for
guidance; and it was hard, when these studies
were popular, for the conscientious to withdraw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
entirely to what the others called a narrow, limited
education. It often led to contention among
members of the same church, and often even parents
and children failed to agree on the subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrong
methods
retained</div>

<p>“But gradually,” continues Mosheim,
“the <i>friends of philosophy and literature
acquired the ascendency</i>. To this
issue Origen contributed very much;
for having early imbibed the principles of the
<span class="smcap">new Platonism</span>, <i>he inauspiciously applied them
to theology</i>, and earnestly recommended them to
the numerous youth who attended on his instruction.
And the greater the influence of this man,
which quickly spread over the whole Christian
world, the more readily was his method of
explaining the sacred doctrines propagated.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin
of the
papacy</div>

<p>The days when the papacy should be
recognized as the beast of Revelation
13 were fast approaching. Such experiences
in the history of education
in the Christian church show how rapidly the
life of the Master, the Spirit of truth, was giving
place to the form of godliness which denied
the power thereof. One reading thus the pages
of history can not fail to see that the papacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<i>was formed in the minds of men</i>, <span class="smcap">was propagated
in the schools, and really took birth
in the educational system then developed</span>.
The political power, which was called upon to
help the church, simply carried out at the point
of the sword those principles which were developed
in the schools. The two streams—paganism
and apostate Christianity—united; and in
the mad current which flowed from their confluence,
men’s souls were lost forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian Education</span> is the pure water of life,
clear and sparkling, which flows from the throne
of God; but when mingled with the turbid waters
of the valley, it is lost sight of, and the current
is evil. The part played by Platonic philosophy
can not be overlooked. The foundation had
already been laid in the third century for the
scholasticism of the Middle Ages, and that
“noontide of the papacy which was the world’s
moral midnight” was fast approaching.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PAPACY—AN EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM</span></h2>

<p>Previous chapters have revealed these facts:
1. That the Jewish nation was set as a light to the
world. This light was to shine by means of education,
and the Jews were to be teachers of the
nations. 2. The Jewish nation lost its position
as leader in educational reform, and, consequently,
in all other particulars, because it departed from
the pure system of education delivered to the
Fathers, and mingled with the heathen, especially
with the Greeks and the Egyptians.</p>

<p>In substantiation of this fact we have these
words of Neander: “The Jews, completely imbued
with the elements of Hellenic culture, <i>endeavored
to find a mean between it and the religion of their
fathers</i>, which they had no wish to renounce. To
this end they availed themselves of the system
most in vogue with those who, in Alexandria,
busied themselves with religious matters—that
of the <i>Platonic philosophy</i>, which had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
acquired a mighty influence over their own intellectual
life.... On the one hand, they firmly
adhered to the religion of their fathers.... On
the other hand, their minds were possessed by a
philosophical culture at variance with these convictions.
They were themselves not unconscious of
the conflicting elements that filled their minds, and
must have felt constrained to seek some artificial
method of combining them into a harmonious
whole. Thus they would be involuntarily driven
to intercalate in <i>the old records of religion</i>, which
for them possessed the highest authority, a <i>sense
foreign to their true spirit</i>, supposing all the while
that they were thereby really exalting their dignity
as the source of all wisdom.”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> 3. <i>This intercalation
of Greek philosophy</i> with the truth delivered
to the Jewish nation brought the schools of the
Hebrews to such a position that the Son of man,
when receiving His education, avoided them altogether,
and in His public teaching warned His people
against the schools of the doctors, who for the
Word of God taught the traditions of men. <i>This
mingling of education then meant the crucifixion
of Christ and the ruin of the Jewish nation.</i>
4. The early Christian church, composed of members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
called out from the Jewish schools and from
the purely pagan doctrines, at first taught their
children truths based upon the Scriptures; but
before the close of the first century, the tendency to
commingle Christian teachings and heathen philosophy
was already noticeable. Paul, writing to the
Thessalonians, referring to this fact, said, “The
<i>mystery of iniquity</i> doth already work.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal
education
sophistry</div>

<p>This tendency, seen in the days of Paul,
grew into a habit; and as Christian youth
prepared for gospel work by attending
the schools at Alexandria and elsewhere,
an entire change took place.</p>

<p>It now becomes our duty to follow this changed
system of education, which is indeed but a mixture
of Christian and pagan, and hence not a separate
and distinct system at all. It was designated by
the apostle to the Gentiles as “the mystery of
iniquity.” As found in the third century, Mosheim
described it thus: “It is necessary, however, to
observe that the methods now used of defending
Christianity, and attacking Judaism and idolatry,
degenerated much from the primitive simplicity,
and the true rule of controversy. The <i>Christian
doctors</i>, who had been <i>educated in the schools of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the rhetoricians and sophists</i>, rashly employed the
arts and evasions of their subtle masters in the
service of Christianity; and, intent only upon defeating
the enemy, they were too little attentive
to the means of victory, indifferent whether they
acquired it by artifice or plain dealing. This
method of disputing, which the ancients called
economical, and which <i>had victory for its object,
rather than truth</i>, was, in consequence of the prevailing
taste for rhetoric and sophistry, almost
universally approved.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The effect of the Christian schools’ teaching
Greek literature, sophistry, and rhetoric was bearing
its fruit in an unmistakable way. The simplicity
of the gospel and of the man of God, who
was the <i>truth</i>, was fast passing away. Even at
this early date we find the germ of the order of
Jesuits, who, in the Middle Ages, carried out the
theory of the Platonists, and asserted “that it was
no sin for a person to employ falsehood and fallacies
for the support of truth, when it was in danger
of being borne down.” It was at this time,
and under the influence of these same doctors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
teachers, that there arose the practice of attributing
the writing of certain books to illustrious
authors; “hence, the book of canons, which certain
artful men ascribed falsely to the apostles,
... and many other productions of that nature,
which, for a long time, were too much esteemed by
credulous men.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> How far men had departed
from the simplicity of the gospel is evident.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Error
introduced
by
teachers</div>

<p>The spread of ideas contrary to the
purity of the gospel was almost universally
begun in the schools professing to
be Christian; and teachers were, almost
without exception, the leaders in these intellectual
moves, which in reality form the basis for every
change in government or religion. Throughout
the history of the centuries, men have arisen who
were noted for their intellectual prowess, men of
strong mind, who were searching for truth. By
tracing the work of a few representative teachers
through the first three or four centuries, <i>we see the
papacy appearing as the direct result of educational
principles</i>.</p>

<p>In order to make this clear, let us begin with
the teachings of Clement in the school of Alexandria.
It may be hard to distinguish between truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and error, as we trace the intricate windings of
philosophy in the days of the early church; but it
is necessary to find the origin of those leading
principles of the papacy against which the Reformation
contended. In order to do so, we go to
the source of the stream, which is usually found
at Alexandria, in the schools conducted by Christian
teachers, or doctors, as they are often called.
The foremost, the all-absorbing doctrine of the
papacy, is the substitution of works for faith.
Christ’s one lesson, illustrated in hundreds of ways,
to the multitudes and to the few, was wisdom by
faith, eternal life by faith. The early church
was founded upon this principle, and faith in
God’s Word was the first maxim in the home
school, in the church school, and in the seminaries
of the early Christians. Faith gives the hearing
ear, as in the case of Solomon; this gives the
ability to <i>study</i>, which brings true wisdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corruption
took place
gradually</div>

<p>How or where faith was lost can not be
stated in positive terms. As wood,
under favorable conditions, changes, bit
by bit, into solid stone, one atom of
wood giving place to a grain of sand, and so
on till the form of the tree, once an embodiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of life, now lies a hard and lifeless stone,
retaining, however, each scar of branch and
leaf, each crack or wrinkle of the bark, yea,
even the annual marks of growth and the grain
of the wood; so faith in God’s Word was lost,
atom by atom, and the lost faith was replaced
by human philosophy. Alexandria was to the
Christian school what the marsh is to the fallen
tree. Much Greek philosophy contained elements
of truth; many truths were by the Greeks put in
brilliant settings. God himself had evidently revealed
to the minds of men, such as Plato, Pythagoras,
Aristotle, and others, principles of truth;
but it was not supposed that men to whom had
been opened the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
through His word and through His Son should
ever find it necessary to search for a few gems of
truth amidst a mass of error. Turning from the
pure light to search for these stray thoughts in
Greek philosophy, <i>men lost their faith in God,
failed to give His word its proper place</i>, and erelong
the living, fruit-bearing tree was but an image
of its former self, molded in stone.</p>

<p>That the reader may see that this mingling of
truth and error was adopted in place of the pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
word, he is referred to Neander’s description of
Clement and his quotations of that eminent
scholar’s reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Clement’s
school
work</div>

<p>Without taking the space necessary to
give this quotation, we pass to the
thought that Clement introduced this
Greek philosophy into the school he
was teaching, and through his disciples paved the
way for the papacy in its power. Of the Alexandrian
school we read: “What was the original aim
of the school itself? Was it at the outset merely
an institution for communicating religious instruction
to the heathen, or had there long existed in
Alexandria a school for educating teachers for the
Christian church—a sort of theological seminary
for the clergy?... We find that originally a
single person was appointed by the bishop of Alexandria
to hold the office of catechist, whose business
it was to give religious instruction to the heathen
and probably <i>also to the children of the Christians
in that place</i>.... Men were required for this
office who possessed a perfect acquaintance with
the Grecian religion, <span class="smcap">and most especially must
they have received a philosophical education,
so as to be able to converse and to dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
with any learned pagans</span>, who, after long investigation
on other questions, might turn their attention
to Christianity.</p>

<p>“<i>It was not enough to teach here, as in other
churches, the main doctrines of Christianity....</i>
<span class="smcap">With these enlightened catechumens</span>,
it was necessary to go back to the primitive
sources of the religion in Scripture itself, and to
seek to initiate them into the understanding of
it—for such required a faith which would stand
the <i>test of scientific examination</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In order to meet the demands made by pagans
and Greek philosophers the school stooped from
its exalted position of teaching a wisdom acquired
by faith, and substituted a course of study which
“would <i>stand the test of scientific examination</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clement
and higher
criticism</div>

<p>Clement, one of the earliest teachers
in this school, “points out the need
of high and rich talents in the holder
of the catechetical office at Alexandria.”
“The range of instruction imparted by these
men,” says Neander, “gradually extended itself,
for they were the first who ... attempted to
satisfy a want deeply felt by numbers—the want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of a <i>scientific exposition of the faith, and of a
Christian</i> science.” Here is perhaps the best
place for one to attribute the change from faith
to a scientific demonstration of the truths of the
universe. Here is marked the time, so far as
one is able to point it out with definiteness, of
the transit from education by faith to education
of the senses, from the spiritual to the intellectual
and the physical. The fruit and the utter
folly of the wisdom of the Greek and Egyptian
sages (?) of this intellectual system are seen in its
ripened state in the Dark Ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
students
fed on
pagan
ideas</div>

<p>The same paragraph in Neander continues:
“To their school were attracted
not only those educated pagans, who,
having by their teaching been converted
to Christianity, and being seized with
a desire to devote themselves and all they possessed
to its service, chose ... the Alexandrian
catechists for their guides, but also <i>those youths</i>,
who, having been brought up within the Christian
pale, were thirsting after a more profound
knowledge, in order to prepare themselves for
the office of <i>church teachers</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposing
voices</div>

<p>This school did not find its pathway
always strewn with roses; for there
were church teachers of the primitive
class “who looked chiefly to the practical and
real, ... and who were in continual dread of
a corruption of Christianity by the admixture
of foreign philosophical elements,” and these
offered some opposition to the transit from an
education of faith in God’s Word to one of scientific
investigation and reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clement’s
justification</div>

<p>Those were days of lively debate, and
the defenders of Christian education
more than once contended for its
principles. “‘Thus much,’ observes
Clement, ‘I would say to those who are so fond
of complaining: if the philosophy is unprofitable,
still the study of it is profitable, if any good is
to be derived from thoroughly demonstrating that
it is an unprofitable thing.’” This argument is
indulged in at the present time by those who
espouse the cause of modern education, and wish
to defend the study of the classics and the doctrine
of evolution.</p>

<p>The words of Clement in his arguments sound
doubly striking, when we remember that to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the feeling that the education of the senses will
ultimately tend to the grasping of eternal truth
by faith is just as firmly held as then, notwithstanding
the fact that a careful investigation shows
that this can never be the case, and that the
only avenue to <i>truth</i> is through faith, first, last,
and all the time. He says: “Perhaps the latter
[philosophy] was given to the Greeks in a
special sense, as preliminary to our Lord calling
the Gentiles, since it educated them as the law
did the Jews, for Christianity; and philosophy was
a preparatory step for those who were to be
conducted through Christ to perfection.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Clement
lost his
faith</div>

<p>Accordingly, we find Clement perpetually
verging toward the gnostic or
platonic position. “With an idea of
faith which flowed from the very essence
of Christianity, there was associated in his
mind the still lingering notion, derived from the
Platonic philosophy, of an opposition between a
<i>religion of cultivated minds</i>, and arrived at by the
medium of science, and a religion of the many,
who were shackled by the senses and entangled
in mere opinion.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Birth of
the papacy</div>

<p>Here is distinctly seen the beginnings
of that system of education which elevates
the few and holds the masses in
subjection. Herein lies the wellspring of a monarchical
government and a papal hierarchy. It was
the propagation of the system of education introduced
into the Alexandrian school by Clement that
formed the papacy. We are not surprised to read
in history of the contest between the churches of
Alexandria, Constantinople, and Rome. Rome as
arbiter was called to decide between the Greek
Catholics and the Alexandrians; and from the
downfall of both her rivals she gained the pontifical
throne; but it was only to crown the educational
ideas of the Alexandrian school, and sway
the world by the enforcement of the principles of
that system of instruction <i>which substitutes scientific
research for faith</i>.</p>

<p>God had once called his people out of Egypt;
but the church, forsaking the purity of the gospel,
returned thither for its education. The Reformation
was its second call, and to-day the third call is
sounding. Having followed with some care the
ideas first introduced by Clement, and finding that
the result of the position taken by this teacher was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that faith was destroyed and scientific reason substituted,
we turn to the further development of this
educational idea as advocated by one of Clement’s
most noted pupils and his successor in the Alexandrian
school. I refer to Origen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origen</div>

<p>Origen was born 185 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, in Alexandria;
he received a most liberal education,
and was initiated at an early age into Hellenic
science and art; the principles of Christianity were
instilled into his mind by such teachers as Clement
of Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> “He says himself that it was an
outward motive that first led him to busy himself
with the study of Platonic philosophy, and to make
himself better acquainted generally with the systems
of those who differed from himself. <i>The
moving cause was his intercourse with heretics
and pagans who had received a philosophical
education.</i>”</p>

<p>“Attracted by his great reputation, such persons”
came often to him, and he thus defends
himself for bestowing his time on the Greek philosophy:
“When I had wholly devoted my time
to the promulgation of the divine doctrines, and the
fame of my skill in them began to be spread
abroad, so that both heretics and others, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
had been conversant with the Greek sciences, and
particularly men from the philosophical schools,
came to visit me, it <i>seemed to me necessary that I
should examine the doctrinal opinions of the heretics,
and what the philosophers pretended to know
of the truth</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>These facts concerning Origen are given because
the argument is strikingly similar to that used by
many ministers and teachers of the present day,
and because it shows how the Platonic philosophy
gained such a foothold in so-called Christian
schools, and grew into the papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representatives
of three
systems</div>

<p>There are three individuals who stand
as representatives of three systems of
education. <span class="smcap">Plato</span> personifies heathen
philosophy; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> said of Himself, “I
am the ... truth;” <span class="smcap">Origen</span> personifies the mixture
of the two,—truth and error,—and hence
stands, from an educational standpoint, as <i>the
father of the papacy</i>, which is the mystery of
iniquity. It behooves us now to follow carefully
the work of this man. After doing so, one can
more readily understand why the beast is represented
as having several heads.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Faith
displaced
by speculation</div>

<p>I quote extensively from Mosheim:
“The principal doctrines of Christianity
were now explained <i>to the people</i> in their
native purity and simplicity, without any
mixture of abstract reasonings or subtile inventions;
nor were the feeble minds of the multitude
loaded with a great variety of precepts. But the
<span class="smcap">Christian doctors</span> who had applied themselves
to the study of letters and philosophy, soon abandoned
the frequented paths, and <i>struck out into
the devious wilds of fancy</i>. The Egyptians distinguished
themselves in this new method of
explaining the truth. They looked upon it as a
noble and glorious task to bring the doctrines of
celestial wisdom into a certain subjection to the
precepts of their philosophy, and to make deep and
profound researches into the intimate and hidden
nature of those truths which the divine Saviour
had delivered to his disciples. <span class="smcap">Origen was at
the head of this speculative tribe.</span> This
great man, enchanted by the charms of the
<i>Platonic philosophy</i>, set it up as the test of all
religion, and imagined, that the reasons of each
doctrine were <i>to be found in that favorite philosophy,
and their nature and extent to be determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
by it</i>. It must be confessed that he handled this
matter with modesty and with caution; but he still
gave an example to his disciples, the abuse of
which could not fail to be pernicious, and under
the authority of which, they would naturally
indulge themselves without restraint in every wanton
fancy. And so, indeed, the case was; for the
disciples of Origen, breaking forth from the limits
fixed by their master, <i>interpreted, in the most
licentious manner</i>, the divine truths of <i>religion
according to the tenor of Platonic philosophy</i>.
From these teachers the <i>philosophical or scholastic
theology</i> derives its origin.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning
of higher
criticism</div>

<p>Mosheim says: “Origen unquestionably
stands at the head of the interpreters of
the Bible in this century. But with
pain it must be added, he was first
among those who have found in the Scriptures a
secure retreat for all errors and idle fancies. <i>As
this most ingenious man could see no possible
method of vindicating all that is said in the
Scriptures against the cavils of the heretics</i> and
the enemies of Christianity, <span class="smcap">provided he interpreted
the language of the Bible literally</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
he concluded that he must expound the sacred
volume <i>in the way in which the <span class="smcap">Platonists were
accustomed to explain the history of their
gods</span></i>.”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Higher
criticism
is Platonism</div>

<p>Murdock, in his notes, says: “Origen
perversely turned a large part of Biblical
history into moral fables and many of
the laws into allegories. Probably he
learned this in the school of Ammonius, which
expounded Hesiod, Homer, and the whole fabulous
history of the Greeks allegorically. The predecessors
of Origen, who searched after a mystical sense
of Scripture, still set a high value on the <i>grammatical,
or literal, sense;</i> but he often expresses himself,
as if he attached no value to it. Before him
allegories were resorted to, only to discover predictions
of future events and rules for moral
conduct; but he betook himself to allegories <i>in
order <span class="smcap">to establish the principles of his philosophy</span></i>
on a Scriptural basis.... His propensity
to allegories must be ascribed to the
fertility of his invention, <i>the prevailing custom</i>
of the Egyptians, <i>his education, the instructions
he received from his teachers</i>, and the example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
both of the philosophers, of whom he was an
admirer, and of the Jews.... He hoped, by
means of his allegories, more easily to convince
the Jews, to confute the gnostics, and to silence
the objections of both. But we must not forget
his attachment to that system of philosophy which
he embraced. <i>This philosophy could not be reconciled
with the Scriptures; ... and therefore the
Scriptures must be interpreted allegorically</i>, that
they might not contradict his philosophy.... As
the body is the baser part of man, so the literal is
the less worthy sense of Scripture; and as the
body often betrays good men into sin, so the literal
sense often leads us into error.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Here is
reason
above
faith</div>

<p>Mosheim himself tells us how Origen
determined when a passage should be
interpreted literally and when allegorically:
“Whenever the words, if understood
literally, will afford a valuable meaning, one
that is worthy of God, useful to men, and accordant
with truth and correct reason, <i>then the literal
meaning is to be retained</i>; but whenever the
words, if understood literally, will express what
is absurd, <i>or false, or contrary to correct reason,
or useless, or unworthy of God</i>, then the literal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sense is to be discarded, and the moral and mystical
alone to be regarded. This rule he applies to
every part both of the Old Testament and the
New.” This reasoning is sufficiently strong for
any of our modern <i>higher critics</i>. If it led directly
to the removal of the Word of God from the common
people of the Middle Ages, because teachers
adjudged no minds but their own capable of determining
whether a certain passage should be interpreted
literally or allegorically, to what will the
same treatment of the Scriptures now lead? And
if the disciples of Origen lacking the caution of the
great teacher, were led into the gross licentiousness
of the heathen, how much of the wickedness of
modern society should be attributed to the spirit
of higher criticism, echoed from the pulpit, and
breathed from the schoolroom?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minds
prepared
for the
papacy</div>

<p>Mosheim continues: “He [Origen] assigns
two reasons why fables and literal
absurdities are admitted into the Sacred
Volume. The first is, that if the literal
meaning were always rational and good, the reader
would be apt to rest in it, and not look after the
moral and mystical sense. The second is, that
fabulous and incongruous representations often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
afford moral and mystical instructions which could
not so well be conveyed by sober facts and representations.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this is enough to show that scholasticism,
or a philosophical interpretation of the
Scriptures had its origin in the Christian schools.
By this it is plain why these youth became
papists, instead of followers of the meek and
lowly Galilean. There was no other theory which
could, so effectually as this, have stamped out
faith. No other teaching than this same higher
criticism could have more truly developed that
power which “speaketh great words against the
Most High, and thinketh to change times and
laws.” It formed the beast in the third century;
it is forming the image to the beast in the present
century. Students under such instruction had
received ample preparation for a belief in the right
of the church to interpret Scripture, and a belief
in the infallibility of the pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scholasticism
and
higher
criticism</div>

<p>We have seen the origin of two of the
streams which, uniting, helped swell
the torrent of the papacy. There are
still other tributaries to this mighty
river. Each rises somewhere in heathendom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
flows with a devious course, but finally, as if in
accordance with some great natural law, unites
with those other currents in forming the mystery
of iniquity. Each stream is an educational principle,
opposed in itself to Christianity; but instead
of being lost in the depths of the main channel,
it seems to develop greater power of doing evil,
and brings its adherents into more complete degradation
after the mingling than before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mysticism</div>

<p>The third principle which presents itself
for analysis is known as <i>mysticism</i>.
Both the teachings of Clement and the scholasticism
of Origen exalted reason above faith. Mysticism
was advocated by Origen and later by
Augustine. It is defined as “that faculty of
reason, from which proceeds the health and

into the human soul, and comprehended in it
the principles and elements of all truth, human
and divine.”<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> There is a spark of divinity in
every man. It is the object of Christian education
to develop the image of Christ in the human
being; but with the mystics, it was maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
that “silence, tranquillity, repose, and solitude,
accompanied with such acts of mortification as
might tend to extenuate and exhaust the body,
were the means by which the hidden and internal
word was excited to produce its latent virtues
and to instruct men in the knowledge of divine
things.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
continues
to decline</div>

<p>It is not so much with the doctrine as
with the results which were wrought by
the teachings of such doctrine, that we
are concerned. From an adherence to
this method of reasoning arose the whole monkish
system; for, says Mosheim, “This method
of reasoning produced strange effects, and drove
many into caves and deserts, where they macerated
their bodies with hunger and thirst, and submitted
to all the miseries of the severest discipline that a
gloomy imagination could prescribe.” Egypt soon
swarmed with these fanatics, and the whole history
of the Dark Ages circles around them. They
broke the bonds of family affection, overturned
governments, and seated popes. Draper, speaking
of the monks, says: “It is said that there were at
one time in that country [Egypt] of these religious
recluses not fewer than seventy-six thousand males<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and twenty-seven thousand females. With countless
other uncouth forms, under the hot sun of that
climate they seemed to be spawned from the mud
of the Nile.” “From Egypt and Syria monachism
spread like an epidemic.” “It was significantly
observed that the road to ecclesiastical elevation lay
through the monastery porch, and often <i>ambition
contentedly wore for a season the cowl, that it
might seize more surely the miter</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Monks
control
schools</div>

<p>We shall need to study the monastic
system as the repositories of learning
in the Dark Ages, and therefore give
but a passing glance at the origin of
the order in the doctrine of mysticism. Its evils
can not be portrayed without a blush, and it was
against this system, taking as it did into its
clutches the education of the masses, that the
Reformation thrust its weight. We have seen
truth <i>struggling</i> against error. It was in the
<i>schools</i> of <i>the early Christians</i> that wisdom <i>by
faith</i> was taught. It was <i>into these same schools</i>
that pagan philosophy crept. It was the teacher
who espoused this philosophy, and again a teacher
who opposed it. Students imbibed the ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the leading educators, and became church teachers.
The strongest minds, turning from the Word, and
that alone, became expounders of philosophy and
the sciences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools of
the Dark
Ages</div>

<p>Gradually error prevailed, until in the
schools, almost entirely in monastic
hands, truth was so covered that D’Aubigné’s
description of the work of the
schoolmen of the Dark Ages is striking. He says:
“These industrious artisans of thought had unraveled
every theological idea, and of all their threads
had woven a web, under which it would have been
difficult for more skillful persons than their contemporaries
to recognize the truth in its pristine
purity.”</p>

<p>It is not the province of this chapter to deal
with theological controversies in themselves. It
is only as these controversies took possession of
and molded the courses of study in the schools;
only as they found their strongest supporters in the
persons of teachers, and were carried to the world
by students, that our attention is drawn to another
line of argument, which, as it were, clenched the
work of the papacy, and gave it its power over the
minds of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pelagianism
taught</div>

<p>Quoting again from D’Aubigné: “The
<i>Pelagian</i> doctrine, expelled by Augustine
from the church when it had presented
itself boldly, insinuated itself as demi-Pelagianism,
and under the mask of the Augustine forms of
expression. This error spread with astonishing
rapidity throughout Christendom. The danger of
the doctrine was particularly manifested in this,—that
by placing goodness without, and not within,
the heart, it set a great value on external actions,
legal observances, and penitential works....
Whilst Pelagianism corrupted the Christian doctrine,
it <i>strengthened the hierarchy</i>.... When
it laid down a doctrine that man could attain a
state of perfect sanctification, it affirmed also that
the merits of saints and martyrs might be applied
to the church.... Pelagianism multiplied rites
and ceremonies.</p>

<p>“But it was especially by the <i>system of penance</i>,
which flowed immediately from Pelagianism, that
Christianity was perverted. At first, <i>penance</i> had
consisted in certain public expressions of repentance....
By degrees it was extended to every
sin, even to the most secret.... Instead of looking
to Christ for pardon, through faith alone, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sought for principally in the church through penitential
works.... <i>Flagellations</i> were superadded
to these practices.... They accordingly invented
that system of barter celebrated under the title of
<i>Indulgences</i>.... A bull of Clement VII declared it
an article of faith.... The philosophers of Alexandria
had spoken of a fire in which men were to
be purified. <i>Many ancient</i> doctors had adopted
this notion; and Rome declared this philosophical
opinion a tenet of the church. <i>The pope by a bull
annexed purgatory to his domain.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> “The Catholic
Church was not the papacy,” says D’Aubigné.
“The latter was the oppressor, the former the
oppressed.” Draper tersely defines the papacy as
“<span class="smcap">the tyranny of theology over thought</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary</div>

<p>Men departed from the simplicity of a
gospel by faith. Reason and scientific
research took the place of faith in the Word. Education
turned men’s minds from God to self, and
reason was exalted. The papacy was thus formed.
If we look for a visible union of the church and
the state before recognizing it as the papacy, we
shall find ourselves entrapped; <i>for it is the working
out of a system of education based on human
philosophy that forms the papacy</i>; and the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
which adopts this system of education naturally
turns to the state for support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papacy
overthrown
by
Christian
education</div>

<p>It is because of the truth of this statement
that the papacy wields its influence
through its schools; this is why it has
always feared a revival of learning more
than the combined forces of all the
armies of the world. A death-blow to the papacy
can be struck only by introducing a system of
education founded upon the teachings of Christ,
placing God’s Word as guide, and inspiring faith
as the one avenue to wisdom.</p>

<h2 id="XI">XI<br />
<span class="smaller">EDUCATION OF THE MIDDLE AGES</span></h2>

<p>The development of the papacy led directly
to the Dark Ages, for “the noontide of the
papacy was the world’s moral midnight.” The
papacy was the logical working out of an educational
scheme; hence the moral darkness which
spread over the world during the prophetic period
of twelve hundred and sixty years was due to
wrong methods of education. People do not sink
into degradation and sin when properly educated.
Truth elevates, and, when embodied in man,
brings him nearer to his Maker. Faith is the
ladder by which he climbs, and when that element
has been lacking in an educational system,
the masses have sunk lower and lower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papacy’s
tyranny
of theology
over
thought</div>

<p>Mind is a wonderful thing, the most
profound study of the universe. It was
designed to be free, to grasp the mighty
laws of its own Creator, and a means
was supplied by which that very thing
could be done: “If any of you lack wisdom, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
him ask of God, ... but let him ask in faith,
nothing wavering.”</p>

<p>In order to maintain the supremacy thus
gained, it was necessary for the education of the
young to lie wholly within the control of the
papal hierarchy; and it is with their educational
institutions and educational methods that we have
now to deal. It is hoped that the study of the
Dark Ages will so accentuate the importance of
Protestants’ maintaining their own schools, that
the tendency now so strong in the other direction
may receive a check. The education begun
in the schools of the early Christians has been
followed into the monastic institutions of the
Middle Ages. The life and power of Christianity
departed, and form alone remained. It has been
said that “paganism in the garb of Christianity
walked into the church,” and it can truthfully be
added that <i>it gained admittance through the
schools</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal
primary
schools</div>

<p>In order to trace carefully the education
offered by the papacy,—and that comprised
all that was then offered,—the
first quotations are concerning primary
instruction. Laurie says: “Instruction began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
about the age of seven. The <i>alphabet</i>, written
on tables or leaves, was learned by heart by the
children, <i>then syllables and words</i>. The first
reading-book was the Latin psalter, and this was
read again and again <i>until it could be said by
heart</i>; and numerous priests, and even monks,
were content all their lives with the mere sound
of Latin words, which they could both read and
recite, but did not understand.”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prominence
of
memory
work</div>

<p>Note carefully that work for these children
was almost wholly <i>memory</i> work.
They were to <i>learn by heart</i> and to
<i>repeat without understanding</i>. This
was the first step in that great system which
binds the minds of the masses to the will of one
sovereign mind.</p>

<p>“Writing followed.” “The elements of arithmetic
were also taught, but merely with a view
to the calculation of church days and festivals.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early use
of Latin</div>

<p>“Latin was begun very early (apparently
immediately after the psaltery was
known), with the <i>learning by heart</i> of
declensions and conjugations and lists of vocables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
The rule was to use Latin in the school in conversing....
In the eleventh century, if not
earlier, Latin conversation-books ... were not
only read, but, like everything else, <i>learned by
heart</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Their method of studying Latin emphasizes
the thought of the formal abstract way of
teaching, which tended to conservatism and mental
subjection. “Memory is the faculty that subordinates
the present under the past, and its extensive
training develops a habit of mind that holds by
what is prescribed, and recoils from the new and
untried. In short, the educational curriculum that
lays great stress on memorizing, produces a class of
conservative people.”<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The papal schools employed
methods which, in themselves, in the course
of a few generations would develop dependent
rather than independent thinking; therefore
methods are as important as the subject taught.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Result of
universal
language</div>

<p>Again it is well to remember that there
was a deep design in making the Latin
tongue universal. It was one of the
ways by which the papacy kept its control
of all nations and tongues. Draper explains
it thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“The unity of the church, and, therefore, <i>its
power</i>, required the use of Latin as a sacred
language. Through this Rome had stood in an
attitude strictly European, and was enabled to
maintain a general international relation. It gave
her far more power than her asserted celestial
authority.... Their officials could pass without
difficulty into every nation, and communicate
without embarrassment with each other, from
Ireland to Bohemia, from Italy to Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fables
and traditions
of
men</div>

<p>The character of the youth was formed,
says Painter, from memorizing “the
<i>fables of Æsop</i> and collections of maxims
and proverbs. After this, Virgil
was usually the text-book, and was handled in the
same style.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Studies of
Monastic
schools</div>

<p>Of the monastic schools Mosheim says:
“In most of the schools, the so-called
seven liberal arts were taught. The
pupil commenced with grammar, then
proceeded to rhetoric, and afterward to logic or
dialectics. Having thus mastered the Trivium, as
it was called, those who aspired to greater attainments
proceeded with slow steps through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<i>Quadrivium</i> [a course including arithmetic, music,
geometry, and astronomy] to the honor of perfectly
learned men.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Says Painter: “Seven years were devoted to
the completion of the course in liberal arts [the
Trivium and the Quadrivium].... Dialectic or
logic was based somewhat remotely on the writings
of Aristotle. At a later period, logic was rigidly
applied to the development of theology, and
gave rise to a class of scholars called the schoolmen....
Arithmetic was imperfectly taught,
importance being attached to the supposed secret
properties of numbers. Geometry was taught in
an abridged form, while astronomy did not differ
materially from astrology. The study of music
consisted chiefly in learning to chant the hymns
of the church.”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Greater
emphasis
on logic</div>

<p>Mosheim thus continues his description
of the work of the schools in the eleventh
century: “This course of study,
adopted in all the schools of the West,
was not a little changed after the middle of this
century. For logic, ... having been improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
by the reflection and skill of certain close thinkers,
and being taught more fully and acutely, acquired
such an ascendency in the minds of the majority,
that they neglected grammar, rhetoric, and the
other sciences, both the elegant and the abstruse,
and devoted their whole lives to dialectics, or to
logical and metaphysical discussions. For whoever
was well acquainted with dialectics, or what
we call logic and metaphysics, was supposed to
possess learning enough, and to lose nothing by
being ignorant of all other branches of learning....
In this age, the philosophy of the Latins was
confined wholly to what they called dialectics; and
the other branches of philosophy were unknown
even by name. Moreover their dialectics was miserably
dry and barren.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Patristical
Geography</div>

<p>This is sufficient, perhaps, on the use of
language and logic, and we turn to geography
and some of the sciences. Even
the children to-day will smile at the
teachings of some of the Church Fathers on the
subject of geography. Says Draper: “In the Patristic
Geography the earth is a flat surface bordered
by the waters of the sea, on the yielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
support of which rests the crystalline dome of the
sky. These doctrines were for the most part supported
by passages from the Holy Scriptures, perversely
wrested from their proper meaning. Thus
Cosmas Indicopleustes, whose Patristic Geography
had been an authority for nearly eight hundred
years, triumphantly disposed of the sphericity of
the earth by demanding of its advocates, how, in
the day of judgment, men on the other side of
a globe could see the Lord descending through
the air!”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The beneficial
work
of explorers</div>

<p>It was in opposition to such theories,
and a hundred absurdities concerning
the ocean, the boiling waters of the
equator, the serpents in the West, etc.,
that Columbus, De Gama, and other explorers had
to contend; and one of the most wonderful effects
of the work of these navigators was the thrust
given papal education. A wound was then received
which was incurable.</p>

<p>If, in the mind of the reader, the question arises,
Why should the papal schools teach such things?
simply consider that the whole system of papal
theology was intended to make the people feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the world was the center of the universe, and that
the pope was the center of the world. Christ and
his position in creation were usurped by the head
of the church. <span class="smcap">This was the papacy.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern
schools
cling to
papal
methods</div>

<p>This could be brought about <i>only by education</i>,
and could be maintained only as
generation after generation was <i>taught</i>
from infancy to old age to place faith
in man, not God. Not only the subjects
taught, but the manner of teaching them,
served well the purpose of the papacy. Only
within the last few years, comparatively speaking,
have our own schools seen the necessity of breaking
away from some of those relics of the educational
system of the Dark Ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Detection
of wrong
methods</div>

<p>Memory work, pure and simple, has
given way in a great measure to research
and experiment, even in the primary
grades. The alphabet is no longer
driven into the childish mind by the ferule, nor
kept there by mere force of repetition. The
advanced methods in dealing with the mind are a
step in the right direction. The pity is that educators,
while groping for light, while casting off
some of the moth-eaten garments of past ages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have failed to see the cause of the evil, and deal
so largely with results instead of removing the
cause. The evil began by renouncing the Scriptures
and faith in Holy Writ as a part of education.
The spirit and power will accompany reform only
when these are replaced in their proper setting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New
books</div>

<p>While educators of the world are realizing
the need of a change in methods, it
is time for them to see also the need of
a change in subject matter and text-books. <i>Protestants</i>
in particular <i>should arouse</i> to the times. If
the study of paganism, instead of Christianity or
truth, produced the Dark Ages, and if wrong
methods held the minds of men and prolonged
that darkness, forbidding the shining of the light,
it is time for both <i>methods and material</i> to be
reconstructed in the schools of to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science in
the papal
schools</div>

<p>We can with profit notice the attitude of
the papal schools toward some of the
sciences, taking for example that most
practical of modern branches, the science
of medicine. What was the work of the physician
during the Dark Ages? Draper says: “Physicians
were viewed by the church with dislike, and
regarded as atheists by the people, who held firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to the lessons they had been taught, that cures
must be wrought by relics of martyrs and bones of
saints, by prayers and intercessions.”<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">True
healing
forsaken</div>

<p>It is well to remember that Christ was
the Great Physician, healing not only
soul maladies, but physical infirmities as
well; and to the apostles was given the
commission to heal the sick and restore sight to
the blind. Gradually, however, as the power of
the gospel in its purity was lost by the substitution
of error for truth, the leaders of the church
introduced miracle cures, and preached the efficacy
of the bones of saints, etc., in the cure of disease.
This became popular, and increased throughout
the Dark Ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
study discouraged</div>

<p>Draper describes the fanaticism of the
monastic schools, and finally assigns a
reason for the exclusion from them of
the study of physiology and anatomy and
the science of medicine. “The body,” he says,
“was under some spiritual charge,—the first joint
of the right thumb being in the care of God the
Father, the second under that of the blessed
Virgin, and so on of other parts. For each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
disease there was a saint. A man with sore eyes
must invoke St. Clara, but if it were an inflammation
elsewhere, he must turn to St. Anthony....
For the propitiation of these celestial beings
it was necessary that fees should be paid, and
thus the practice of imposture—medicine became
a great source of profit. In all this there was no
other intention than that of extracting money.”<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctors
in secret</div>

<p>While such was the teachings of the
papacy, the Jews and Mohammedans
were achieving wonderful success, and
making discoveries of lasting benefit to mankind
in Spain and Asia Minor. “Bishops, princes,
kings, and popes had each in private his Hebrew
doctor; though all understood that he was a
contraband luxury, in many countries pointedly
and absolutely prohibited by the law. In the
eleventh century nearly all the physicians in
Europe were Jews.” One reason for this was:
“The church would tolerate no interference
with her spiritual methods of treating disease,
which formed one of her most productive sources
of gain; and the study of medicine had been formally
introduced into the rabbinical schools.”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jewish
physicians
prohibited</div>

<p>The bitter hatred of the papacy toward
independence of mind is well illustrated
in the treatment that the Jewish physicians
received from the popes. Draper
says: “The school at Salerno was still sending
forth its doctors. In Rome, Jewish physicians
were numerous, the popes themselves employing
them.... At this period Spain and France
were full of learned Jews; and perhaps partly by
their exerting too much influence upon the higher
classes with whom they came in contact (for the
physician of a Christian prince was very often the
rival of his confessor), and partly because the
practice of medicine, as they pursued it, interfered
with the gains of the church, the clergy
took alarm, and caused to be re-enacted or enforced
the ancient laws. The Council of Beziers
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1246) and the Council of Alby (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1254) prohibited all Christians from resorting to
the services of an Israelitish physician.”<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hatred of
physicians</div>

<p>To show that this was a matter which
concerned the <i>schools</i>, and in proof of
the statement that papal schools still
adhere to formalism, miracle cure, and relic worship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
we need only to notice that “the faculty
of Paris [University], awakening at last to the
danger of the case, caused, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1301, a decree
to be published prohibiting either man or woman
of the religion of Moses from practicing medicine
upon any person of the Catholic religion. A
similar course was pursued in Spain. At this
time the Jews were confessedly at the head of
French medicine. It was the appointment of one
of their persuasion, Profatius, <i>as regent</i> of the
faculty of Montpellier, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1300, which drew
upon them the wrath of the faculty of Paris.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jews
banished</div>

<p>“The animosity of the French ecclesiastics
against the Jewish physicians at
last led to the banishment of all the
Jews from France, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1306.”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The papal
universities were unwilling to teach medicine, and
finding that the Jewish schools of science were
greatly weakening papal authority in France, this
race was banished bodily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of
physiology</div>

<p>Comparing this history with the present
work of the medical fraternity, and
especially with that class of medical
students whose life work is to spread the gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
while relieving the body, one better understands
that physiology should be the basis of every educational
effort, and the place that it and kindred
sciences should occupy in the courses of instruction
pursued by our children, youth, and maturer
minds; and also the cause of that spiritual
darkness which is even now hanging over the
world, and for centuries held Europe in its
clutches; but it shall be pierced by Christian
education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal
method of
meeting
opposition</div>

<p>The papacy, in case of opposition which
threatened her authority, had two methods
of procedure. The first was an
attempt to annihilate both the trouble
and the troublers. Thus she simply banished
all Jews from France that her own universities
might not be overshadowed by the light of truth.
Her second method of procedure was a counter-reformation;
that is, if a reform in education
arose outside the church which threatened to
undermine her doctrines, it might be met by
a partial reform within her borders, the reform
going only so far as was absolutely necessary to
satisfy the cravings of minds that dared think
for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Papacy
can
compromise</div>

<p>It was not always possible to completely
crush a reformation, or the reformers;
and as was quite often the case in the
schools, studies which could not be
entirely banished, were taught, but in such a way
as best to conserve the needs of the church.
That medicine, as well as law, was taught in the
higher papal schools, can not be denied. Says
Mosheim: “The seven liberal arts [The Trivium
and the Quadrivium] were gradually included under
the term <i>philosophy</i>; to which were added
<i>theology</i>, <i>jurisprudence</i>, and <i>medicine</i>. And thus
these four <i>faculties</i>, as they are called, were in
the next century formed in the universities.”<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical
study
corrupted</div>

<p>But in the study of medicine, as in philosophy
or law, memory work devoid of
understanding—the form without the
spirit—was the characteristic. As the
saints and martyrs in theology had taken the place
of the Greek gods and goddesses, so in the study
of other branches a multitude of pagan terms,
clothed with what was then known as the “Christian
spirit,” was made to satisfy the longing for
real mental culture. The simplicity of the gospel
was laid aside. What God had revealed was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to appear too complex for the human mind, and
the secret things which are known only to God
were pried into. In theology, dialectics, or logic,
became the study of endless queries, difficult syllogisms,
meaningless quibbles. Men delighted in
propounding such questions as, “How many
angels can stand on the point of a needle?” and
others prided themselves on the acuteness of their
reasoning powers in arguing such questions. Likewise
in medicine, the study of the simple needs
of the body and the rational treatment of disease
was obscured by hundreds of <i>Latin terms</i>, and
these were memorized to the neglect of the simple
philosophy of the science. It is with this multitude
of names, hoary with age, and savoring
strongly of their pagan origin, that the student of
medicine is still compelled to grapple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arabs
as educators</div>

<p>The history of the rise of European
universities throws light on the attitude
of the papacy toward education. While
Europe was overspread by spiritual and
intellectual darkness, God used another people to
disseminate truth. When faith in God was lost,
and in its place was substituted that blind faith in
man and obedience to the church which is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in European history as the age of faith, learning
was propagated by the Arabs. That power which
had failed to conquer the world by the sword, now
gained by intellectual culture what the arms of Mohammed
and his immediate successors failed to
achieve. Spain, while in the hands of the Moors,
contributed more to European civilization than at
any other time in her history; and it was as an
<i>educator</i> and through the <i>influence of her schools</i>
that the papacy received its blow from the south
which made her more readily succumb to the revolt
of Germany under Luther. By the Arabs
“flourishing schools were established in all the
principal cities, notably at Bagdad and Damascus
in the East, and at Cordova, Salamanca, and
Toledo in the West. Here grammar, mathematics,
astronomy, philosophy, chemistry, and
medicine were pursued with great ardor and success.
The Arabians originated chemistry, discovering
alcohol, and nitric and sulphuric acids.
They gave algebra and trigonometry their modern
form; applied the pendulum to the reckoning of
time; ascertained the size of the earth by measuring
a degree, and made catalogues of the stars.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
And all this was done when Europe as a whole was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
lying in darkness, when the chemist was considered
a wizard, when astronomy was merely astrology,
and whatever learning existed was formal and
spiritless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabs and
papal
schools</div>

<p>But the discoveries of the Arab teachers
could not long remain with them alone,
and it is with the spread of their ideas
through the schools by means of the
students that we are concerned. “For a time
they [the Arabs] were the intellectual leaders of
Europe. Their schools in Spain were largely
attended by Christian youth from other European
countries, who carried back with them to their
homes the Arabian science, and through it stimulated
intellectual activity in Christian [papal]
nations.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arabs and
universities</div>

<p>The specialization of studies such as
theology, medicine, or philosophy, together
with the impulse derived from
the Mohammedans in Africa and the
Arabs in Spain, led to the establishment of the
universities, which were, as before stated, composed
of four faculties, or colleges. “They
arose independently of both church and state.”
The University of Paris “became the most distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
seat of learning in Europe. At one
time it was attended by more than twenty thousand
students.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papacy
seized
universities</div>

<p>The growth of the universities was
very rapid, and they threatened speedily
to revolutionize the society of
Europe and overthrow the papal hierarchy.
“The influence and power of the universities
were speedily recognized,” says Painter;
“and though originally free associations, they
were soon brought into relation with the church
and the state, by which they were officially
authorized and endowed.” If learning could not
be suppressed, then it must be controlled by the
church; and the “church sought to attach them
[the universities] to itself, in order to join to the
power of faith the power of knowledge. The
first privileges that the universities received proceeded
from the popes.” “While Rome was not
the mother, she was yet the nurse of universities.”
Scientific investigation had by this time
received such an impulse from youth who had
been students in the Arab schools that the church
could not hope to crush it. The only hope of
the papacy was to so surround the truth with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fables and mysteries, and to so conduct the
schools, that again the spirit of progress would
be lost in its labyrinthine wanderings through
empty forms. <i>Monopoly in education</i> works
havoc in the same way that a monopoly in commerce
leads to oppression. And so it was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of
students</div>

<p>“The students led a free and uncontrolled
life, seeking and finding protection
in their own university authorities
even from the civil power.”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
courses
and degrees</div>

<p>Youth from the age of twelve and upward
attended these universities, making
it necessary to teach the secondary studies
which terminated in a bachelor’s
degree. “Boys ... attended the Parisian university
merely for instruction in ... grammar,
rhetoric, and dialectic; and after three or four
years’ study they received the title of Baccalaureus.”
“When he reached ... the age of
seventeen or eighteen, he then began the study
for the mastership.”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that the schools established
by the early church were marked for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
simplicity of their methods, and their singleness
of purpose. Their object was to educate workers
for the spread of the gospel. For the accomplishment
of this object the course of instruction was
arranged, and students were sent forth into the
world commissioned of God, as were the disciples
after their ordination. There was no call for the
granting of degrees. These, it is true, were used
in the pagan schools, and indicated that the receiver
had been initiated, after years of study, into
the hidden mysteries of Greek wisdom. Among
the pagans, indeed, the principle of degrees and
diplomas dated back to the days of Egyptian and
Babylonian supremacy, where it was indicative of
fellowship in the grossest forms of licentiousness.</p>

<p>Greece, the country which united the learning
of Babylon and the wisdom of Egypt, and offered
it to Europe in the form of Platonism, naturally
enough made use of diplomas and degrees. And
the fact that her wisdom was so complicated in its
nature made it necessary to spend long years in
mastering her sciences.</p>

<p>Paganism, moreover, has but one model for all
men; its aim is ever to crush individuality and
mold all characters alike. To accomplish this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the schools arranged their studies in courses,
demanding that each student should pass over the
same ground. This is characteristic of all educational
systems aside from that one, the true education,
which comes from God. If you look to
China, you find it there, as it develops the disciples
of Confucius; India educates her Brahmans in the
same manner; the priests and wise men of Egypt
were taught in schools of a similar type. The
Jews had aped the fashion of the pagan world, and
it was from this custom that Christ called his
disciples. One of the surest signs that the schools
established in the days of Christian purity had lost
the spirit which characterized the apostolic teaching,
is the fact that the schools of the Middle Ages
had adopted this pagan custom.</p>

<p>Students were called into the universities when
mere boys, and by hundreds and thousands were
run through the “grind” which we term “course
of instruction,” and were turned out at the end of
ten, twenty, and sometimes even forty years with
a degree, which, in dignity, corresponded to the
years spent in completing the course.</p>

<p>This custom is papal. It is opposed to the very
spirit of Christianity; and any institution of learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
which deigns to accept the approval of the
state, while at the same time passing as a Christian
institution, is not only linking itself with the
papacy, but with paganism as well. Of His followers
Christ says, “They are not of the world,
even as I am not of the world.”</p>

<p>“Older students, those especially in the theological
faculty, with their fifteen or sixteen years’
course of study, achieved in this respect far greater
notoriety. At the age of thirty or forty the student
at the university was still a scholar.”<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The idea
of long courses is not, then, a modern one, and
American colleges can truthfully point to the university
of Paris for the precedent in this respect as
in some others. In the granting of degrees another
interesting subject is approached. Laurie continues:
“Up to the middle of the twelfth century,
anyone taught in the infant universities who
thought he had the requisite knowledge.... In
the second half of the twelfth century, when
bishops and abbots, who acted, personally or
through their deputies, as chancellors of the rising
university schools, wished to assume to themselves
exclusively the right of granting the license, ...
Pope Alexander III forbade them, on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that the teaching faculty was a gift of God.”<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
This, however, must have been the work of a liberal
pope, for earlier,—that is, in 1219,—“Pope
Honorius III interfered with the granting of degrees;
and in order to impose a check on abuses,
directed that they should be conferred not by, but
by permission of, the archdeacon of the cathedral,
and under his presidency.”<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The church had gained control of the universities,
and through her representative, usually the
chancellor, <i>granted degrees</i>. Now, in order to
keep the authority well in her own hands, no one
was allowed to teach who did not hold a license
granted by the university after an examination.
Thus the educational <i>trust</i> developed, and the
iron hand of Rome, though concealed in a silken
glove, clinched her victories, and strove to crush
all opponents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degrees
and the
papacy</div>

<p>Our modern B.S., M.A., LL.D.,
D.D., etc., were adopted into the
universities at this stage of educational
history. “Itter informs us,” says Laurie,
“that ... a complete university course was
represented by <i>four degrees</i>—<i>bachelor</i>, <i>master</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
<i>licentiate</i>, and finally <i>doctor</i>, which last was
usually taken at the age of thirty or thirty-five.”
“The next development of the degree system was
the introduction of the <i>grades of bachelor</i> and
<i>master</i>, or licentiate, into each of the higher
faculties—theology, law, and medicine. Thus
a man who had finished his preliminary art studies,
generally at the age of twenty-one, and wished to
specialize in theology, medicine, or law, had to
pass through the stages of <i>bachelor</i> of theology,
or of medicine, or of law, and then of <i>master</i> or
licentiate, before he obtained the title of <i>doctor</i>.
The <i>bachelorship</i> of medicine or law was reached
in three years, of theology in seven. Four years’
further study brought the <i>doctor’s degree</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> “The
conferring of degrees was originated by a pope.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
The educational monopoly appeared quite complete;
and having gained the form of godliness and the
civil power, the old scheme of killing the life and
substituting those things which would recognize
the papal hierarchy, were again introduced. Leading
educators are awakening to the true situation.
Christian education alone can deliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Form had
replaced
the life</div>

<p>“The moral tone of the universities
was low,” says Painter; “there were
brawls, outbreaks, and abominable immoralities.
‘The students,’ say the
Vienna statutes, ‘shall not spend more time in
drinking, fighting, and guitar playing than at
physics, logic, and the regular courses of lectures;
and they shall not get up public dances in the
streets. Quarrelers, wanton persons, drunkards,
those that go about serenading at night, or who
spend their leisure in following after lewd women;
thieves, those that insult citizens, players at dice—having
been properly warned and not reforming,
besides the ordinary punishment provided by law
for those misdemeanors, shall be deprived of their
academical privileges and expelled.’ These prohibitions
give us a clear insight into university
life of the time, for it was not worse at Vienna
than at Paris and elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Could some of those medieval students be resurrected
and placed in some of the universities of
the nineteenth century, they might feel quite at
home, not only as far as courses of study and the
granting of degrees is concerned, but in revelings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
parties, etc., judging from the reports of the hazing,
drinking, and general carousing of the students
in our university towns.“<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The conduct of students
is the reflex of the instruction given. It is
not, therefore, to be wondered at that the instruction
of the universities, containing as it did the
form without the life, should fail to develop stability
of character in its students.</p>

<p>“The true Catholic attitude to all investigation
was, and is, one admitting of great advances in
every department of learning, while checking all
true freedom of thought.”<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The <i>North American Review</i> for October, 1842,
expresses in concise language the relation of students
and schools to the general government and
consequent state of society. It says: “In the
colleges is determined the character of most of
the persons who are to fill the professions, teach
the schools, write the books, and do most of the
business of legislation for the whole body of the
people. The general direction of literature and
politics, the prevailing habits and modes of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
throughout the country, are in the hands of men
whose social position and early advantages have
given them an influence, of the magnitude and
permanency of which the possessors themselves
are hardly conscious.”</p>

<p>Recognizing this fact, the papacy controlled
the education of the Middle Ages, and is to-day
seeking to do the same thing. Luther and other
reformers, also recognizing this fact, sought to
overthrow the tyranny of the papacy by establishing
new schools where freedom of thought would
be fostered through faith in God’s Word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work for
Protestants
to-day</div>

<p>Protestants to-day, looking upon the system
of education as it now exists, and
tracing there the same long courses
in the classics and the sciences; the
same degrees granted in a manner similar to
the Dark Ages, the text-book containing the
same theories, the same terms, the same doctrines
of philosophy; the same tendency toward
monarchism, or the monopoly of education by
certain universities, and through them by the same
power that has borne sway, should, for the sake of
their government, and for the sake of their faith,
establish schools of their own. As the papacy, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the subjection of thought, builds up a monarchy
in place of democracy; as she in the same way
overthrows faith in God, substituting faith in man
or the church, so <i>Protestant schools should educate
children</i> in the pure principles of that gospel
freedom which recognizes the equality of every
man in the sight of heaven, and makes it possible
for the government to be of, for, and by
the people by developing the Christian character
through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2 id="XII">XII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY REFORMATION AN EDUCATIONAL REFORM</span></h2>

<p>While following the history of education
through the Dark Ages, we have often been
compelled to recognize that an influence was at
work slowly but surely undermining the structure
which the papacy was, with the greatest perseverance,
erecting, and which that power purposed
should withstand all the attacks brought against it.
The papacy had calculated well; it had, in absorbing
the educational system of the times, laid its
hand on the very tap-root of society, and, in
its education as well as in its doctrines, woven
about the human race meshes which only the
Prince of heaven could rend with the sword
of eternal truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secret of
papal
strength</div>

<p>Never has the world seen such an enduring
system as the papacy. Patterned so
nearly after the truth of God, and resembling
so closely, both in church government
and educational principles, the plan delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to the chosen nation, that only an expert, guided
by the Spirit of truth, could judge between the
true and the counterfeit, it had, as had the Jews
before them, replaced the life by the mere form.
Nevertheless, so firmly laid was the foundation, and
so substantially built were the walls, that for centuries
it baffled all attempts at overthrow.</p>

<p>This structure had as its foundation an <i>educational
system</i>; the mortar which held the bricks in
the wall was <i>educational methods</i>, and should the
building fall, the foundation itself must be attacked.</p>

<p>As a civil power, the papacy was periodically
attacked by ambitious kings and princes; but these
shocks scarcely disturbed the serenity of the papal
head, so firm was his throne. The sword of the
Mohammedans was broken at Tours; and the
Crescent, instead of advancing to the full by encircling
the Mediterranean, waned as its light receded
to the shores of Africa and the west of Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The revival
of learning</div>

<p>What the Turk could not do by force of
arms, he did in another way. In 1453
Constantinople fell into the hands of the
calif, yet this did not affect the strength of the
papal hierarchy. But as the Turk came into
Greece, Greek art and literature fled to Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Here is the attack on the papacy which came from
the east. Painter says: “The revival of classical
learning, which had its central point in the downfall
of Constantinople in 1453, exerted a favorable
influence. It opened the literary treasures of
Greece and Rome, provided a new culture for the
mind, awakened dissatisfaction with the scholastic
teaching of the church, and tended to emancipate
thought from subjection to ecclesiastical authority.”<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
The taking of Constantinople did still
more toward hastening the Reformation. Venice
had controlled the commerce of the eastern Mediterranean,
but Turkish supremacy in those waters
transferred that power to her rival, Genoa, on the
other side of Italy; and from this latter center
began the search for a western passage to the
East Indies which led to the accidental discovery
of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek
classics</div>

<p>Again, “The revival of learning was so
intimately related to the Reformation,
and to the educational advancement dating
from that time, that it calls for consideration in
some detail. It had its origin in Italy.... Eager
scholars from England, France, and Germany sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
at the feet of Italian masters, in order afterward to
bear beyond the Alps the precious seed of the new
culture.”<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> However, this Greek culture, or new
learning, was nothing more nor less than a revival
of the study of Greek paganism. Notwithstanding
that fact, a life and enthusiasm attended its study
which drew students from the papal universities,
and induced men to travel hundreds of miles for
the sake of sitting at the feet of masters of the
Greek classics.</p>

<p>This was the attempted reform of the papacy
made by classic literature. Its results can not but
interest us. Painter further says: “The revival of
letters produced different results in different countries.
Everywhere it contributed to the emancipation
of the human mind, but in Italy it tended
strongly to paganize its adherents.”</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the classics were attempting
to reform the papacy. Here was the result in
Italy. Italian schools undoubtedly needed reforming,
for the words of Luther describing German
schools are applicable to all papal institutions. Of
these he said: “What have they been taught in
the universities and convents, but to become blockheads?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
A man has studied <i>twenty</i>, <i>forty</i> years,
and has learned neither Latin nor German.” But
as much as reform was needed, Greek classics “in
Italy tended strongly to paganize its adherents.”
We can not look for the classics, then, to Christianize
the Italian papists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greek in
German
schools</div>

<p>But while “in Italy the new learning
became a minister of infidelity, in Germany
[it became a minister] of religion.”
Why this difference? The work of Erasmus,
Luther, and Melancthon, as they introduced
the study of the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures into
the German schools, will answer why. The Italians
studied the Greek classics for the <i>thought</i>,
and it paganized its adherents; the Germans studied
the Greek New Testament, translating it into
the mother tongue, and it became one of the greatest
helps in the spread of the Reformation of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>So much for the attempted reform by Greek
classics. They played their part, but they could
not overthrow the papacy; and why should we
expect it when papal education was, in the first
place, built upon those same classics and the philosophy
of Greek writers?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Papacy
and Arab
education</div>

<p>We now turn to the southern attack
upon the papal system. This was also an
educational attack. Already we have
seen the Arab schools in Spain. Before
the eleventh century Christian youth attended
these schools, taking across the Pyrenees the
science of the Moors. The papacy quailed before
this attack, and in order to lessen its force, the
sciences of the Arabs were adopted in the papal
universities. This, as we have already seen, was
done in medicine and mathematics. But again the
form was retained without the life. France, because
of her jealousy of the Jewish physicians,
through the influence of the University of Paris,
banished every Jew from her borders. A <i>scientific
attack could not overthrow the papacy</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science
and discovery
of
America</div>

<p>However, the Moors went quietly on in
their scientific discoveries; and when the
fall of Constantinople closed the eastern
route to the Indian Ocean, and Genoa
wanted a western route, Spain was prepared to
offer sailors the necessary charts and maps, compasses,
and other mariners’ instruments. Her
astronomical studies, celestial maps, and measurements
of the degrees on the earth’s surface encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
voyages both to the south and west, in direct
contradiction to the theories of the patristic geographies.
When Columbus asked aid at the Spanish
court to fit vessels for the tour across the Atlantic,
it is strange to note that the wife of the king of
Spain, who took from the Moors the keys of
Granada, and drove the Arab and his learning out
of Europe, was the same woman who pledged her
jewels to this man,—a man, who, dependent upon
Arabic scientific investigation, discovered a world
where those same truths might be planted, and
mature untrammeled by papal tyranny. I say
this was more than a coincidence. The hand of
God was in it; and, as D’Aubigné says: “He prepares
slowly and from afar that which he designs
to accomplish. He has ages in which to work.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science
and the
Reformation</div>

<p>While scientific knowledge could not
overthrow the papacy, it had its part to
play along with the classics. When
men were spiritually dead, and the Word
of God was hidden, minds were freed from papal
thraldom by the work of the scientist and the
classical student. Bear in mind, however, that
the classics helped only as they offered the Scriptures;
and science helped only as it opened men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
minds to the reception of the truths of God’s Word.
Mighty forces were at work: the earth itself must
be moved, and the fulcrum whereon rested the
lever by which it was to be turned in its orbit was
the throne of God, and the <i>Word of the Eternal
was the moving power</i>. Men, weak in themselves
but resolute in purpose, were the instruments in
the hand of God to accomplish a task which ages
had waited for, and principalities and powers in
heavenly places had longed to see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reformation
and
education</div>

<p>The Reformation was not the work of a
year, nor yet of one man, even in Germany.
It was the gradual work of a
system of education, and that system
was the same as had formerly been given to Israel,
as had been exemplified and amplified in the life
of Christ, and was at the time of the Reformation
to be revealed, little by little, as men’s minds, long
darkened by oppression, were able to grasp it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forerunners
of the
Reformation</div>

<p>Agricola, known as the father of German
humanism, was one of the earliest
reformers, and his attitude as a teacher
and his expressions concerning education
prove the fact that the Reformation began in the
educational institutions. This man was for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
“a pupil of Thomas à Kempis; he passed several
years at the university of Louvain; subsequently
he studied at Paris, and afterward in Italy,” so
that he was well acquainted with the institutions
of the day. He became a teacher at Heidelberg.
At the age of forty-one he began the study of
Hebrew, in order to read the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agricola’s
ideas of
the school</div>

<p>He was urged to take charge of a school
at Antwerp, but refused, expressing his
opinion of the school in this advice sent
to the authorities: “It is necessary to
exercise the greatest care in choosing a director
for your school. Take neither a theologian nor
a so-called rhetorician, who thinks he is able to
speak of everything without understanding anything
of eloquence. Such people make in school
the same figure, according to the Greek proverb,
that a dog does in a bath. It is necessary to seek
a man resembling the phœnix of Achilles; that is,
who knows how to teach, to speak, and to act at
the same time. <span class="smcap">If you know such a man, get
him at any price</span>; for the matter involves the
future of your children, whose tender youth receives
with the same susceptibility the impress of
good and of bad examples.”</p>

system</div>

<p>His ideas concerning methods were as
clear as those expressed on the subject
of schools and the character of the
teacher. He was evidently able to see
things in advance of his age, and in the
spirit of a seer can truthfully be classed with the
forerunners of the Reformation. In another letter
he writes: “Whoever wishes to study with
success must exercise himself in these three
things: in getting clear views of a subject; in
fixing in his memory what he has understood;
and in producing something from his own resources.”
Each of the three things specified cuts
directly across the methods employed in papal
schools, and which were so necessary to the stability
of that hierarchy. This was the beginning
of the Reformation as seen in education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thought
versus
mere
form</div>

<p>One more quotation from Agricola’s letter
emphasizes the thought that schools
were then conducted where dry form
and abstract memory work were giving
place to thought,—original thought. “It is necessary,”
he says, “to exercise one’s self in composition;
when we have produced nothing, what
we have learned remains dead. The knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that we acquire ought to be like seed sown in
the earth, germinating and bearing fruit.”<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reuchlin
advises
teaching
the Bible</div>

<p><i>Reuchlin</i>, one of Melancthon’s teachers,
recognized the best means of winning
opponents to the truth, and said: “The
best way to convert the Israelites would
be to establish two professors of the
Hebrew language in each university, who should
teach the theologians to read the Bible in Hebrew,
and thus refute the Jewish doctors.” The fact
that such a position exposed Reuchlin to violent
opposition from the monks and papal teachers
shows that he rightly divined the remedy for
papal oppression; and it is significant of an
approaching reformation when he thus recommends
that the Bible be placed in the universities
for study by theologians.</p>

<p>There is a rift in the clouds, and ere long the
sun will appear. But “men loved darkness
rather than light.” Why?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Erasmus</div>

<p>Erasmus, recognized by all as a reformer,
did his work by the publication of the
New Testament in Greek. “The work was undertaken
in the interests of a purer Christianity.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
“It is my desire,” he said, “to lead back that
cold dispute about words called theology to its
real fountain. Would to God that this work
may bear as much fruit to Christianity as it has
cost me toil and application.” Here was a direct
thrust at the study of dialectics in the universities.
The meaningless disputes which constituted the
course in theology was, by Erasmus, to be replaced
by the living word of God. The Reformation
drew nearer, and the papacy shuddered at
the prospect. Gradually the Spirit was returning,
and this is seen more and more as we take
up the life of Luther. The highway had been
cleared by such forerunners as have already been
mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism
fosters
education</div>

<p>“The fundamental principles of Protestantism
are favorable to education,” says
Painter.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> “With the Scriptures and his
conscience for guides, every man is elevated
to the freedom and dignity of ordering his
own religious life. The feeling of individual responsibility
is awakened, and the spirit of inquiry
fostered. Intelligence becomes a necessity. <i>The
Bible must be studied; teachers must be provided;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
schools must be established. <span class="smcap">Protestantism becomes
the mother of popular education.</span></i>”</p>

<p>Again the same author says: “It [Christianity]
does not withdraw man from the ordinary callings
and relations of life; it makes him a steward of
God in the world, and exalts his daily labors in
the household, in the schoolroom, in the workshop,
on the farm, into a divine service. The Protestant
view restores nature, as a subject of investigation,
to its rights. The whole circle of knowledge—whatever
is elevating, whatever prepares for useful
living—is held in honor. <i>Primary and secondary
schools</i> are encouraged; the best methods of
instruction, based upon a study of man’s nature
and not upon the interests of the church, are
sought out. Protestantism is a friend of universal
learning.” One French scholar says: “The
Reformation contracted the obligation of placing
everyone in a condition to save himself by reading
and studying the Bible. Instruction became then
the first of the duties of charity; and all who
had charge of souls, from the father of a family
to the sovereign of the state, were called upon
... to favor popular education.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Luther an
educator</div>

<p>It is no wonder, then, that much of
Luther’s time and ambition was spent
in the cause of education. “The necessities
of the Reformation gave Luther,” says
Painter, “an intense interest in education. The
schools of the time, already inadequate in number
and defective in method, were crippled during the
early stages of the Reformation by the excited and
unsettled condition of society. A new generation
was growing up without education. <i>The establishment
of schools became a necessary measure for
the success and permanence of the Reformation.</i>
The appeal had been made to the Word of God,
and it was necessary to teach the masses to read
it. Preachers and teachers were needed for the
promulgation and defense of the gospel.... As
early as 1524, Luther made an appeal of marvelous
energy to the authorities of the German cities
for the establishment of schools. If we consider
its pioneer character, in connection with its statement
of principles and admirable recommendations,
the address must be regarded the most important
educational treatise ever written.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> God
had trained him for his position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Luther’s
plea for
schools</div>

<p>Here are the words of the Reformer.
Judge for yourselves if they should not
voice the sentiment of every true Protestant
to-day! “He wrote,” says D’Aubigné,
“to the councilors of all the cities of
Germany, calling upon them to found Christian
schools.” “Dear sirs,” said Luther, “we annually
expend so much money on arquebuses, roads,
and dikes, why should we not spend a little to
give one or two schoolmasters to our poor children?
God stands at the door and knocks; blessed
are we if we open to him! Now the Word of God
abounds. O my dear Germans, buy, buy, while
the market is open before your houses. The Word
of God and His grace are like a shower that falls
and passes away. It was among the Jews; but
it passed away, and now they have it no longer.
Paul carried it into Greece; but in that country
also it has passed away, and the Turk reigns there
now. It came to Rome and the Latin empire; but
there also it has passed away, and Rome now has
the pope. O Germans, do not expect to have this
Word forever. The contempt that is shown to it
will drive it away. For this reason let him who
desires to possess it lay hold of it and keep it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Busy yourselves with the children</span>; for
many parents are like ostriches, they are hardened
toward their little ones, and, satisfied with having
laid the egg, they care nothing for it afterward....
The true wealth of a city, its safety, and its
strength, is to have many learned, serious, worthy,
well-educated citizens. And whom must we blame,
because there are so few at present, except your
magistrates who have allowed your youth to grow
up like trees in a forest?”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>D’Aubigné says truly: “It was not the public
worship alone that the Reformation was ordained
to change. The school was early placed
beside the church, and these two great institutions,
so powerful to regenerate the nations, were equally
reanimated by it. <i>It was by a close alliance with
learning that the Reformation entered into the
world; in the hour of its triumph it did not forget
its ally.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Luther “felt that to strengthen
the Reformation <span class="smcap">it was requisite to work on
the young, to improve the schools</span>, and to
propagate throughout Christendom the knowledge
necessary for a profound study of the Holy Scriptures.
<span class="smcap">This was one of the results.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools
strengthen
the church</div>

<p>Painter, describing the educational work
of the great Reformer, says: “With
Luther, education was not an end in
itself, but a means to more effective
service in church and state. If people or rulers
neglect the education of the young, they inflict
an injury upon both the church and state; <i>they
become <span class="smcap">enemies of God and man</span></i>; they advance
the cause of Satan, and bring down upon themselves
the curse of heaven. This is the fundamental
thought that underlies all Luther’s writings
upon education.”<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools
not appreciated</div>

<p>Luther expresses his views briefly in
these words: “The common man does
think that he is under obligation to
God and the world to send his son to
school. Everyone thinks that he is free to bring
up his son as he pleases, no matter what becomes
of God’s word and command. Yea, even our
rulers act as if they were exempt from the
divine command. No one thinks that God has
earnestly willed and commanded that children be
brought up to his praise and work—a thing that
<span class="smcap">can not be done without schools</span>. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
contrary, everyone <i>hastens with his children
after worldly gain</i>.” Luther’s words ringing
down the centuries must be echoed by all true
Protestants to-day. Where are the men with
the courage of educational reformers?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luther’s
educational
plans</div>

<p>“Luther did not concern himself about
the education of the clergy only, it was
his desire that knowledge should not
be confined to the church; he proposed
extending it to the laity, who hitherto had been
deprived of it.... He emancipated learning
from the hands of the priests, who had monopolized
it, like those of Egypt in times of old,
and put it within the reach of all.”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Luther
grasped with wonderful clearness the real meaning
of Christian education, and there is scarcely
a phase of it which he has left untouched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luther’s
methods
a model</div>

<p>“If we survey,” says Dittes, “the
pedagogy of Luther in all its extent,
and imagine it fully realized in practice,
what a splendid picture the schools
and education of the sixteenth century would
present! We should have courses of study, text-books,
teachers, methods, principles, and modes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of discipline, schools and school regulations, that
could serve as models for our own age.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luther’s
ideals of
teachers</div>

<p>The Reformer writes: “Where would
preachers, lawyers, and physicians come
from if the liberal arts were not
taught? From this source must they
all come. This, I say, no one can ever sufficiently
remunerate the industrious and pious
teacher that faithfully educates.... Yet people
shamefully despise this calling among us, as if it
were nothing, and at the same time they pretend
to be Christians! If I were obliged to leave off
preaching and other duties, there is no office I
would rather have than that of school-teacher; for
I know that this work is, with preaching, the most
useful, greatest, and best; and I do not know
which of the two is to be preferred. For it is
difficult to make old dogs docile, and old rogues
pious, yet that is what the ministry works at,
and must work at in great part, in vain; but young
trees, although some may break, are more easily
bent and trained. Therefore, let it be one of <i>the
highest virtues on earth faithfully to educate the
children of others who neglect it themselves</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Germany
established
schools</div>

<p>Germany was aroused. “In 1525 he
was commissioned by the Duke of Mansfield
to establish two schools in his
native town, ... one for the primary
and the other for secondary instruction.” They
were not conducted after the manner of papal
schools, differing only in the fact that the teacher
was a Protestant. “Both in the course of study
and in the methods of instruction these schools
become models after which many others were
fashioned.... In a few years the Protestant
portion of Germany was supplied with schools.
They were still defective, ... but, at the same
time, they were greatly superior to any that had
preceded them. Though no complete system of
popular instruction was established, the foundation
for it was laid. To this great result, Luther
contributed more than any other man of his
time; and <i>this fact makes him the leading educational
reformer of the sixteenth century</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">No compromise</div>

<p>The changes wrought by Luther were
not mere superficial, formal changes;
but as the Reformation, as a religious
movement, struck a death-blow to the papacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
viewed as an educational movement, it is found
to have cut directly across the established methods
of popular education. It meant a change in the
<i>courses</i>, a different idea of <i>graduation</i>, a change in
<i>text-books</i>, in <i>methods of teaching</i>, <i>methods of
study</i>, and <i>character of the teachers</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
nature
study</div>

<p>He was perhaps the first of the reformers
to recognize the value of nature
study. He once said: “We are at the
dawn of a new era; for we are beginning
to recover the knowledge of the external
world that we have lost since the fall of Adam.
Erasmus is indifferent to it; he does not care
to know how fruit is developed from the germ.
But by the grace of God, we already recognize
in the most delicate flower the wonders of divine
goodness and the omnipotence of God. We see
in His creatures the power of His word. He commanded,
and the thing stood fast. See that force
display itself in the stone of a peach. It is very
hard, and the germ that it incloses is very tender;
but, when the moment has come, the stone must
open to let out the young plant that God calls into
life.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It may at first seem strange that the bold,
brave man who aroused the world by his theses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
nailed to the church door, should have a character
to which the gentleness of nature made such a
strong appeal. But Luther was a true preacher
in that he was a teacher. What wonder that his
work was enduring! It stands close beside the
life-work of his Master, Jesus,—the Teacher sent
of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melancthon,
Luther’s
companion
in education</div>

<p>Before carrying the work of Luther further,
it is necessary to introduce a new
character, born, it would seem, at a
moment when his special mental qualities
were most needed and fitted by
heaven to stand by Luther’s side as an
aid and as a comfort in the mighty storm through
which he must pass. I refer to Melancthon; God
chose him as a <i>teacher</i>, and imparted to him, in a
wonderful degree, that gift of the Spirit. A few
extracts from D’Aubigné will show clearly how he
was guided into the paths of the Reformation,
there to become one of the greatest workers for
that cause.</p>

<p>He was born in 1497; hence, when Luther
began his work in 1517, Melancthon was a youth
of twenty. “He was remarkable for the excellence
of his understanding, and his facility in learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and explaining what he had learnt.” “Melancthon
at twelve years of age went to the
University of Heidelberg, ... and took his
bachelor’s degree at fourteen.” “In 1512, Reuchlin
[the reformer referred to on a previous page]
invited him to Tubingen.... The Holy Scriptures
especially engaged his attention.... Rejecting
the empty systems of the schoolmen, he
adhered to the plain word of the gospel.”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus wrote: “I entertain the most distinguished
and splendid expectations of Melancthon.
God grant that this young man may long survive
us. He will entirely eclipse Erasmus.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melancthon
teaches</div>

<p>“In 1514 he was made doctor of philosophy,
and then began to teach. He
was seventeen years old. The grace and
charm that he imparted to his lessons formed the
most striking contrast to the tasteless method
which the doctors, and above all, the monks,
had pursued till then.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melancthon
goes to
Wittemberg</div>

<p>Frederick applied to Erasmus and Reuchlin
for an instructor for the University
of Wittemberg. Melancthon was recommended.
Reaching the university, he
did not make the most favorable impression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Luther and other professors, “when they saw his
youth, his shyness, and diffident manners.” After
his opening address, however, Luther and others
became his ardent admirers. Luther wrote: “I
ask for no other Greek master. But I fear that
his delicate frame will be unable to support our
mode of living, and that we shall be unable to
keep him long on account of the smallness of his
salary.”</p>

<p>The spirit of Christianity and of Christian education
had drawn two souls together, and the success
of the work from this time on depended largely
upon this union. Says D’Aubigné: “Melancthon
was able to respond to Luther’s affection. He
soon found in him a kindness of disposition, a
strength of mind, a courage, a discretion, that he
had never found till then in any man.... We
can not too much admire the goodness and wisdom
of God in bringing together two men so different,
and yet so necessary to one another. Luther
possessed warmth, vigor, and strength; Melancthon
clearness, discretion, and mildness. Luther gave
energy to Melancthon; Melancthon moderated
Luther. They were like substances in a state of
positive and negative electricity, which mutually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
act upon each other. If Luther had been without
Melancthon, perhaps the torrent would have overflowed
its banks; Melancthon, when Luther was
taken from him by death, hesitated, and gave way,
even where he should not have yielded.”</p>

<p>Should you question why I thus dwell upon the
life and character of Melancthon, I reply, Because
from this union of two souls flowed the great educational
reform of the sixteenth century. The two
did what neither could have done alone; and the
study of their lives alone reveals the secret of success
in Christian education to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melancthon
revolutionizes
Wittemberg</div>

<p>It was a notable day to Wittemberg
when Melancthon arrived. “The barrenness
that scholasticism had cast over
education was at an end. <span class="smcap">A new manner
of teaching and of studying
began with Melancthon.</span> ‘Thanks to him,’
says an illustrious German historian, ‘Wittemberg
became the school of the nation.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal
education
dropped</div>

<p>“The zeal of the teachers [Luther
and Melancthon] was soon communicated
to the disciples. It was decided
to reform the method of instruction.
With the electors’ consent, <span class="smcap">certain courses that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
possessed merely scholastic importance were
suppressed</span>; and at the same time the study of
the classics received a fresh impulse. [Remember,
however, that this study of the classics was
the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures.] <span class="smcap">The school
at Wittemberg was transformed, and the contrast
with other universities became daily
more striking.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Result
of
changes</div>

<p>The results of these changes were no
less marvelous than the changes themselves.
The author last quoted says:
Wittemberg “flourished daily more and
more, and was eclipsing all the other schools. A
crowd of students flocked thither from all parts
of Germany to hear this extraordinary man, whose
teaching appeared to open a new era in religion
and learning. These youths, who came from
every province, halted as soon as they discovered
the steeples of Wittemberg in the distance; they
raised their hands to heaven, and praised God for
having caused the light of truth to shine forth
from this city, as from Zion in times of old, and
whence it spread even to the most distant countries.
A life and activity, till then unknown,
animated the university.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a school did not call together a class of
students careless in habit and listless in study;
for the fare, as before noted, was meager, and
there was no great outward display. Those who
attended came seeking for truth; and as their
souls were filled with spiritual meat, they returned
to their homes, “even to the most distant countries,”
to spread the truths of Christian education.
Luther himself wrote: “Our students here
are as busy as ants.” Two thousand students
from all parts of Europe thronged the lecture
room of Melancthon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melancthon’s
view of
education</div>

<p>The life and work of those two animating
spirits at Wittemberg can not be
measured by any earthly standard.
Melancthon said: “I apply myself solely
to one thing, the defense of letters. By our example
we must excite youth to the admiration of
learning, and induce them to love it for its own
sake, and not for the advantage that they may
derive from it. The destruction of learning brings
with it the ruin of everything that is good,—religion,
morals, and all things human and divine.
The better a man is, the greater his ardor in the
preservation of learning; for he knows that, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
all plagues, ignorance is the most pernicious.”
“To neglect the young in our schools is just
like taking the spring out of the year. They,
indeed, take away the spring from the year who
permit the schools to decline, because <span class="smcap">religion
can not be maintained without them</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Melancthon
prepared
text-books</div>

<p>Luther had stated that a reform in
methods and courses was necessary.
Melancthon had assisted in that work.
He did still more. Breaking away as
they did from the educational system of the universities
of the world, and basing instruction upon
the Word of God, it became necessary to have
new text-books. Melancthon applied himself with
great diligence to this duty. He was an arduous
student, often arising at three in the morning, and
many of his works were written between that hour
and the dawn. Besides his Greek and Latin
grammars he is the author of works on logic,
rhetoric, physics, and ethics. “These works,
written in a clear and scientific form, soon became
popular, and some of them held their place in the
schools for more than a hundred years.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Study of Theology</span> had been degraded
into the pursuit of subtle arguments and idle controversies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Melancthon wrote a work on dogmatic
theology, publishing it in 1521. Of this work,
Luther wrote: “Whoever wishes to become a
theologian now enjoys great advantages; for, first
of all, he has the <i>Bible</i>, which is so clear that he
can read it without difficulty. Then let him read
in addition the Loci Communes of Melancthon....
If he has these two things, he is a theologian
from whom neither the devil nor heretics shall be
able to take away anything.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparatory
schools</div>

<p>Melancthon’s life was not devoted alone
to the education of such students as
could attend Wittemberg, nor were his
changes of the educational system applicable
only to the higher schools and universities.
Stump says: “Amid all the distractions and anxieties
of this period, Melancthon steadily directed
his efforts to the advancement of education and
the building up of good Christian schools. During
a period covering many years, he found time, in
spite of his numerous other engagements, to give
elementary instruction to a number of young men
who lived with him in his own house. He did this
on account of the lamentable lack of suitable
<span class="smcap">preparatory schools</span>. He lost no opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
however, to provide for this lack, whenever he
found it possible to do so.</p>

<p>“In the spring of 1525, with Luther’s help, he
reorganized the schools of Eisleben and Magdeburg.
He went to Nuremberg, and assisted in the
establishment of a gymnasium [high school] in that
city; and in the following spring he returned to
Nuremberg, and formally opened the school. He
delivered an address in Latin, in which he dwelt
upon the importance of education, and the credit
which the movers in this enterprise deserved. He
declared that ... ‘<i>the cause of true education is
the cause of God</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Both church schools and higher schools, those
offering instruction for students preparing for the
universities, were organized by Melancthon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes
were bitterly
opposed</div>

<p>This work was not allowed to proceed
without some bitter attacks from the
schoolmen and representatives of papal
education. For illustration of this fact,
we have the words of D’Aubigné: “The schools,
which for five centuries past had domineered over
Christendom, far from giving way at the first blow
of the Reformer [Luther], rose up haughtily to
crush the man who dared pour out upon them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
flood of his contempt.” “Doctor Eck, the celebrated
professor of Ingolstadt, ... was a doctor
of the schools and not of the Bible; well versed in
the scholastic writings, but not in the Word of God....
Eck represented the schoolmen.” “Eck
was a far more formidable adversary than Tetzel
[the vender of indulgences], Prierio, or Hochstraten;
the more his work surpassed theirs in learning
and in subtlety, the more dangerous it was.”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
Thus Luther’s most bitter enemies were those who
had once been his warm friends, and those who
offered the strongest opposition to his work were
the teachers in the universities of Germany. Luther
was sometimes almost overcome in spirit by
the ingratitude shown, and of Doctor Eck he once
wrote: “If I did not know Satan’s thoughts, I
should be astonished at the fury which has led this
man to break off so sweet and so new a friendship,
and that, too, without warning me, without
writing to me, without saying a single word.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Saxony
school
plan</div>

<p>It was in order to meet the opposition
offered by the schoolmen, and to put the
Reformation on a firm basis, that Luther
and Melancthon formulated the Saxony
school plan, and reorganized the German schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Stump says: “In the year 1527, Melancthon
took part with Luther in the visitation of the
schools and churches of Saxony. It was high time
for such a step. Affairs were in a wretched condition.
In many places no religious instruction
was given at all, because there were either no pastors
and teachers stationed there, or those who
were stationed there were grossly ignorant themselves.
The greatest disorder imaginable reigned
nearly everywhere.... The financial condition
of many of the churches was equally bad.... It
was the object of the visitation to bring order out
of this chaos. Melancthon was charged with making
a beginning in Thuringia. The spiritual distress
which he discovered rent his heart, and he
often went aside, and wept over what he saw.”
“In 1528 Melancthon drew up the ‘Saxony school
plan,’ which served as the basis of organization for
many schools throughout Germany.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reforms
advocated
by this
plan</div>

<p>According to this plan, teachers were to
avoid “burdening the children with a
<i>multiplicity of studies</i> that were not only
unfruitful, but even hurtful.” Again,
“The teacher should not burden the children with
too many books,” and “it is necessary that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
children be divided into classes.” “Three classes,
or grades, are recommended,” and the subjects
taught should be adapted to the age and condition
of the pupil. Thus, avoid too many studies for
children and youth; do not put too many books
into their hands; group them according to their
ability. This “plan” seems to resist the cramming
system so universally followed to-day almost
as vigorously as it opposed the papal schools of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results, if
Luther’s
plans
fulfilled</div>

<p>A great work was set on foot,—a revolution
which was to affect the ages
which followed. In the brief space of
one man’s life, plans were laid, <i>especially
in the educational work</i>, which, if carried
out by his successors, would have placed Germany
in a position to rule the world. Instead of returning
to the pit from which she had been dug, her
schools and universities might have been models
worthy of imitation throughout Europe and in
America. Luther died, and Melancthon, his co-laborer,
was unable to carry forward the work.
Theologians, pastors, ministers, into whose hands
the work of the Reformation rightfully fell, <i>instead
of multiplying Christian schools</i>, and carrying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
perfection the methods of instruction introduced
by Luther and Melancthon, <i>passed by the greatest
work of the age</i>, and by internal strifes and theological
disputes lost the hard-won battle. The
seeds of truth had been sown in <i>republicanism</i>
and <i>Protestantism</i>, and these two institutions
should have been held in Germany. <i>Education</i>—<span class="smcap">Christian
education</span>—alone could hold them
there. This was neglected; and as lost children,
the two went hand in hand to the Netherlands, to
England, and finally to America, in search of a
fostering mother,—a pure system of education.
The spirit and life so manifest in the teaching of
the great Reformers, passed on, leaving Europe
with the <i>form</i>. A house empty, swept, and garnished
does not long so remain. The form was
occupied by the spirit of the papacy, and Europe
relapsed into a position from which she can be
reclaimed only by a renewal of the plans of the
sixteenth-century Reformers—a system of <span class="smcap">Christian
education</span>.</p>

<h2 id="XIII">XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REACTION AFTER THE EDUCATIONAL REFORMATION</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Widespread
effects of
the Reformation</div>

<p>The most momentous event of the
world’s history, excepting alone the
birth of the Redeemer, was the Reformation
of the sixteenth century. Great
religious movements have occurred before
and since, but they are eclipsed by the brilliancy
and far-reaching results of this one. More
men have been reached, more lives revolutionized,
than by the combined forces of all changes in civil
and domestic circles since that time. The fact is,
that when the causes of political changes in the
modern world are considered, it must be acknowledged
by every candid thinker that these changes
are due in one way or another to the attitude
assumed by the people concerned toward that one
Reformation which was set in motion by the Wittemberg
monk. Christ had been forgotten, and
He came before the world again in the days of
Luther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>A few quotations from Ranke show how far the
Reformation extended in the brief space of forty
years; and since we are dealing with the causes
of this rapid spread, it is gratifying to see that this
author gives in the most natural way due credit to
the influence of the schools. Two things, then,
should be noticed in reading these selections; first,
the extent of territory covered by Protestant principles;
second, the part played by schools and teachers
in the conversion of nations. It is about the
year 1563.</p>

<p>“In the <i>Scandinavian realms</i> they [the Protestants]
had established themselves the more impregnably,
because there their introduction was
coincident with the establishment of new dynasties,
and the remodeling of all political institutions.
From the very first they were hailed with joy,
as though there was in their nature a primitive
affinity to the national feelings.”</p>

<p>“In the year 1552, the last representatives of
Catholicism in <i>Iceland</i> succumbed.”</p>

<p>“On the southern shores, too, of the <i>Baltic</i>
Lutheranism had achieved complete predominance,
at least among the population of German
tongue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i>Poland</i> it was said, “A Polish nobleman is
not subject to the king; is he to be so to the
pope?”</p>

<p>In <i>Hungary</i>, “Ferdinand I could never force
the diet to any resolutions unfavorable to Protestantism.”</p>

<p>“Protestantism not only reigned paramount in
<i>northern Germany</i>, where it had originated, and
in those districts of upper Germany where it had
always maintained itself, but its grasp had been
extended much more widely in every direction.”</p>

<p>“In <i>Wurzburg and Bamberg</i> by far the greater
part of the nobility and the episcopal functionaries,
the magistrates and the burghers of the towns, at
least the majority of them, and the bulk of the
rural population, had passed over to the reforming
party.”</p>

<p>In <i>Bavaria</i> “the great majority of the nobility
had adopted the Protestant doctrine, and a considerable
portion of the towns was decidedly
inclined to it.”</p>

<p>“Far more than this, however, had been done
in <i>Austria</i>. The <i>nobility of that country studied
in Wittemberg; all the colleges of the land were
filled with Protestants</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>We are not surprised, therefore, to read that
“it was said to be ascertained that not more, perhaps,
than the thirtieth part of the population
remained Catholic: <i>step by step, a national constitution
unfolded itself, formed upon the principles
of Protestantism</i>.” “In the <i>Rauris</i>, and the
<i>Gastein</i>, in <i>St. Veit</i>, <i>Tamsweg</i>, and <i>Radstadt</i>,
the inhabitants loudly demanded the sacramental
cup, and this being refused [in order to compel
them to remain Catholic], they ceased altogether
to attend the sacrament. <i>They withheld their
children, too, from the</i> [Catholic] <i>schools</i>.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Rhenish nobility</i> had early embraced
Protestantism.... In all the towns there existed
already a Protestant party.... <i>The inhabitants
of Mainz, too, did not hesitate to send their
children</i> to Protestant schools. In short, from
west to east, and from north to south, throughout
all Germany, Protestantism had unquestionably
the preponderance.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accomplished
by
education</div>

<p>“The Protestant notions extended their
vivifying energies to the most remote
and most forgotten corners of Europe.
What an immense domain had they
conquered within the space of forty years! From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Iceland to the Pyrenees, from Finland to the
heights of the Italian Alps. Even beyond the latter
mountains opinions analogous had once, as we
are aware, prevailed. <i>Protestantism embraced the
whole range of the Latin church.</i> It had laid
hold of a vast majority of the higher classes, and
of the minds that took part in public life; whole
nations clung to it with enthusiasm, and states had
been remodeled by it. This is the more deserving
of our wonder, inasmuch as Protestantism was by
no means a mere antithesis, a negation of the
papacy, or an emancipation from its rule; it was in
the highest degree positive, a renovation of Christian
notions and principles, that sway human life
even to the profoundest mysteries of the soul.”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Notice again that this was due to the educational
ideas propagated by Protestants, and the reason
why the papacy was so fast losing its foothold was
because it had not yet learned that this Reformation,
<i>which began in schools, and was carried forward
by Christian schools, must be defeated in
schools and by teachers</i>. For forty years Protestants
had the right of way in education, and the
results were stupendous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestant
schools
winning
everywhere</div>

<p>Ranke says: “Protestant opinions had
triumphed in the universities and educational
establishments. Those old champions
of Catholicism [the teachers] who
had withstood Luther were dead, or in
advanced years: young men capable of supplying
their places had not yet arisen. Twenty years had
elapsed in Vienna <i>since a single student of the
university</i> had taken priest’s orders. Even in
Ingoldstadt, pre-eminently Catholic as it was, <i>no
competent candidates of the faculty of theology
presented themselves to fill the places that had
hitherto been always occupied by ecclesiastics</i>.
The city of Cologne founded an endowed school;
but when all the arrangements for it had been
made, it was found that the regent was a Protestant.
Cardinal Otto Truchess established a new
university in his city of Dillingen, <i>with the express
design of resisting the progress of Protestantism</i>.
The credit of this institution was maintained for
some years by a few distinguished Spanish theologians;
but as soon as these left it, <span class="smcap">not a single
scholar could be found in all Germany to succeed
to their places</span>, and even these were likewise
filled with Protestants. <span class="smcap">About this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the teachers in Germany were all</span>, almost
without exception, Protestants. <span class="smcap">The whole body
of the rising generation sat at their feet</span>,
and imbibed a hatred of the pope with the first
rudiments of learning.”<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Success of
Reformation
due
to schools</div>

<p>Stress is not laid on their hatred of the
pope, but on the fact that the rising
generation sat at the feet of Protestant
teachers throughout Germany; that parents
withheld their children from the papal school,
even though it might be necessary in so doing to
send them from home to be educated; and finally,
that the papacy was dying, and Protestantism was
spreading through the work of the schools. Would
that those schools might have retained their pristine
purity and simplicity. No power on earth
could then have retarded the progress of Protestantism,
and instead of only modifying the history
of many countries, it would eventually have swept
from the earth all forms of tyranny, both civil and
religious, for it breathed the freedom of the gospel,
and no oppression could stand before it. It is as
impossible to withstand pure Christian education
as it is to withstand Christ, whose power is its
life and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestants
failed to
recognize
its
strength</div>

<p>It is with a pang that one is forced to
trace in this movement that oft-repeated
chapter in the history of mankind. As
the leader of Israel was allowed to view
the promised land from the top of Pisgah,
but must there lay aside his armor
and sleep the sleep of death because of a departure
from right principles, so Protestantism,
through its schools, looked across Jordan, but
failed to maintain the principle of faith which
could at the crucial moment command the waters
to part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
by faith
lost</div>

<p>One reason for the decline is thus stated
by Painter: “In their efforts to give
Christian doctrine a scientific form [that
is, to formulate it], <i>they lost its spirit</i>.
<i><span class="smcap">Losing its early freedom and life</span>, Protestantism
degenerated in a large measure into what
has been called ‘<span class="smcap">dead orthodoxy</span>.</i>’ ... <i>Christian
life</i> counted for little, and the Protestant
world broke up into opposing factions. Says
Kurtz, who is disposed to apologize for this period
as far as possible: ‘Like medieval scholasticism, in
its concern for logic, theology almost lost vitality.
Orthodoxy degenerated into orthodoxism; <i>externally</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
not only discerning essential diversities, but
disregarding the broad basis of a common faith,
and running into odious and unrestrained controversy;
<i>internally, holding to the form</i> of pure doctrine,
but neglecting cordially to embrace it and to
live consistently with it.’”<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scholasticism
killed
Protestant
schools</div>

<p>How narrow the line between truth and
error! How easy for those who had
been given to eat of the tree of life to
turn to the tree of knowledge of good
and evil! What a pity that Protestant educators
could not remain true to their trust! When on
the eve of success, they turned to the old paths,
and “called into existence a dialectic scholasticism
which was in no way inferior to that of the most
flourishing period of the Middle Ages.”<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Papal
principles are papal, whether advocated by Catholics
or Protestants; having left the fountain of the
pure waters of faith, they turned to the only other
accessible source of knowledge—the pagan world.
That system of education introduced by Luther
and Melancthon, founded upon the <i>Holy Scriptures</i>,
and through them viewing the sciences,
mathematics, and literature, using the latter only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
as a means of illustrating God’s Word, was replaced
by the <i>scholasticism of the Middle Ages</i>. One
involuntarily asks, “How many times, O Israel,
wilt thou return into Egypt?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Form took
the place
of life</div>

<p>This decline is described in the following
quotations taken from Painter, and
they need no comment: “During the
period extending from the middle of the
sixteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth century,
three leading tendencies are apparent in
education. These may be characterized as the
theological, the humanistic, and the practical....
A large share of the intellectual strength of the
age was turned to theology. Every phase of religious
truth, particularly in its doctrinal and speculative
aspects, was brought under investigation.
Theology was elevated to a science, and doctrinal
systems were developed with logical precision, and
<i>extended to trifling subtilities</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In the figure of the Bible they strained for gnats,
meanwhile swallowing the camel. The life was
thus lost in the pulpit and in the theological
schools. It was again the “teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
return to
papal
methods</div>

<p>Painter further says: “The schools,
which stand in close relation to religion,
were naturally influenced in a
large measure by the theological tendencies
of the age. Theological interests imposed
upon the schools <i>a narrow range of subjects, a
mechanical method of instruction</i>, and a cruel
discipline. The principle of authority, <i>exacting</i>
a blind submission of the pupil, prevailed in the
schools of every grade. The young were regarded
not as tender plants to be carefully nurtured and
developed, but as untamed animals to be repressed
or broken.”<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Notice the creeping in of those very characteristics
of papal education so often referred to heretofore:
1, narrow range of subjects; 2, mechanical
instruction,—memory work devoid of understanding;
3, arbitrary government, as seen in the matter
of discipline. To this we must add that which is
the natural accompaniment in papal instruction—the
teaching of Latin. Says Painter, quoting
Dittes: “‘In the higher institutions, and even
in the wretched town schools, <span class="smcap">Latin was the
Moloch</span> to which countless minds fell an offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in return for the blessing granted to a few. <i>A
dead knowledge of words took the place of a
living knowledge of things.</i> Latin schoolbooks
supplanted the book of nature, the book of life,
the book of mankind. And in the popular schools
youthful minds were tortured over the spelling
book and catechism. The method of teaching
was almost everywhere, in the primary as well as
in the higher schools, a mechanical and compulsory
drill in unintelligible formulas. The pupils
were obliged to learn, <i>but they were not educated
to see and hear, to think and prove</i>, and were
not led to a true independence and personal perfection.
<span class="smcap">The teachers found their function
in teaching the prescribed text</span>, not in harmoniously
developing the young human being
according to the laws of nature—a process,
moreover, that lay under the ban of ecclesiastical
orthodoxy.’”<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cramming
system
and memory
work</div>

<p>That there was a cramming process
followed equal to any twentieth-century
school, is evident. “The discipline answered
to the content and spirit of the
instruction.... The principle was to tame the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
pupils, not to educate them. They were to hold
themselves motionless, that the school exercises
might not be disturbed. What took place in their
minds, and how their several characters were constituted,
the school pedants did not understand
and appreciate.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sturm’s
school a
compromise</div>

<p>In order to appreciate the rapidity
with which the relapse took place from
the educational system introduced by
Luther to the medieval principles and
methods, our attention is directed to the school
of John Sturm. This man, “regarded as the
greatest educator that the Reformed Church produced
during this period,” died in 1589, less than
seventy years after the Diet of Worms; hence his
work fell within the half century following those
forty years of unusual prosperity for Protestantism
which has already been noticed. His work is contemporary
with the first Jesuit school of Germany.
The decline is visible in every feature of his work.</p>

<p><i>John Sturm</i> presided for forty years over the
gymnasium of Strasburg, and his boast was that
his institution “reproduced the best periods of
Athens and Rome; and, in fact, he succeeded in
giving to his adopted city the name of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Athens.” Sturm’s school stood as a halfway
mark between the Christian schools and the
purely papal schools of the Jesuits, but since
compromise always places a person or institution
on the side of wrong, in weighing the worth of
his school the balances necessarily tip in favor
of the papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Course
of study
in Sturm’s
school</div>

<p>That his was a mixture of the medieval
classical literature with a thin slice
of Scripture sandwiched in for effect, is
seen in the course of study as outlined
by Painter. The school was divided into ten
classes covering ten years, but only so much is
given as is necessary to show the character of the
studies: “Tenth class—The alphabet, reading,
writing, Latin declensions and conjugations, German
or Latin catechism.” “Ninth class—Latin
declensions and conjugations continued. Memorizing
of Latin words.” The eighth and the seventh
classes are about the same. In the sixth,
Greek is begun. The fifth class is as follows:
“Study of words, ... versification, mythology,
Cicero, and Virgil’s eclogues, Greek vocabulary....
On Saturday and Sunday, one of Paul’s epistles.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
The remaining four classes have much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
“learning by heart,” rhetoric, Paul’s epistles, orations
of Demosthenes, the Iliad of Odyssey;
memorizing and recitation of the Epistle to the
Romans, dialectics, and rhetoric continued; Virgil,
Horace, Homer, Thucidides, Sallust, weekly dramatic
entertainments, and again a reading of Paul’s
epistles.</p>

<p>Such a course of instruction was well fitted to
bridge the gulf between the papacy and Protestantism.
It was imbibing perhaps unconsciously the
spirit of the new papal schools. “History, mathematics,
natural science, and the mother tongue are
ignored. A great gap is left between the gymnasium
and life—a gap that could not be filled
even by the university. In aiming to reproduce
Greece and Rome in the midst of modern Christian
civilization, Sturm’s scheme involves a <i>vast
anachronism</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence
of Sturm’s
school</div>

<p>The Strasburg gymnasium at one time
numbered several thousand pupils representing
Denmark, Poland, Portugal,
France, and England. “Sturm’s influence
extended to <i>England, and thence to America</i>.”
An English writer says: “No one who is acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
with the education given at our principal
classical schools, <i>Eaton</i>, <i>Winchester</i>, and <i>Westminster</i>,
forty years ago, can fail to see that their
curriculum was framed in a great degree on
Sturm’s model.”<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> And yet it is acknowledged
that his “scheme involves a <i>vast anachronism</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern
schools
follow
Sturm</div>

<p>To show that Sturm is the father of
much of the instruction now given in
our high schools and universities, Rosenkranz
says: “John Sturm, of
Strasburg, long before Comenius, had laid the
foundation of what has become the <i>traditional
course of instruction and methods of study in
the classical schools for preparation for college</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reaction
as seen
in discipline</div>

<p>The decline in the matter of instruction
was accompanied by a corresponding
retrogression in the morals of
university students. Painter tells us
that “the state of morals at the universities of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was very
low. Idleness, drunkenness, disorder, and licentiousness
prevailed in an unparalleled degree.
The practice of <i>hazing</i> was universal, and new
students were subjected to shocking indignities.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Duke Albrecht, of the university of Jena, wrote
in 1624: “‘Customs before unheard of, inexcusable,
unreasonable, and wholly barbarian, have
come into existence.’” Then he speaks of the
insulting names, the expensive suppers, and the
carousing of the students, until “‘parents in distant
places either determine not to send their
children to this university, ... or to take them
away again.’”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Protestantism lost much because she ceased
to educate her children.</span> Had Protestantism
remained true to her first principles of education,
her overthrow would have been impossible. She
paved the way for her own fall by departing
gradually from the gospel, and by leaning more
and more toward the classics and scholasticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ignatius
Loyola
solves
the
problem</div>

<p>It was this decline on her own part,
caused by the insidious workings of the
Jesuits, which made possible the great
victories of this order in later years.
It was when Rome saw her youth slipping
from her hands into the Protestant schools,
and as a result, a few years later, found whole
nations refusing obedience, and building for themselves
new forms of government, that, in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
distress, she grasped the offer made by <i>Loyola</i>.
And while the power he represented in its organization,
placed itself above the pope, becoming,
as it were, <i>a papacy of the papacy</i>, still she
accepted his offer, and the <i>counter educational
move</i> began. <span class="smcap">The Jesuits organized to combat
reformation in educational lines.</span> In
speaking of the Jesuits, Painter says: “This
order, established by Ignatius Loyola [in 1534],
found its special mission in combating the Reformation.
As the most effective means of arresting
the progress of Protestantism, it aimed at
controlling education, particularly among the
wealthy and the noble. In rivalry with the
schools of Protestant countries, it developed an
immense educational activity, and earned for its
schools a great reputation.” Again, the same
writer says: “More than any other agency it
stayed the progress of the Reformation, and it
even succeeded in winning back territory already
conquered by Protestantism. Although employing
the pulpit and the confessional, it <i>worked
chiefly through its schools, of which it established
and controlled large numbers</i>. Education in all
Catholic countries gradually passed into its hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuit
schools</div>

<p>In order to understand the reason for
the success of the Jesuits as teachers it
is necessary to glance at the plan of
studies prepared in 1588 from a draft made by
Loyola himself. “Every member of the order,”
says Painter, “became a <i>competent and practical
teacher</i>. He received a thorough course in the
ancient classics, philosophy, and theology. During
the progress of his later studies he was required
to teach.” Jesuit schools contained two courses,
the lower corresponding very closely to the work
of Sturm. Rosenkranz gives an excellent description
of the educational system of the Jesuits. He
says:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Course of
instruction</div>

<p>“In instruction they developed so exact
a mechanism that they gained the reputation
of having model school regulations,
and even Protestants sent their children
to them. From the close of the sixteenth century
to the present time they have based their
teaching upon the <i>Ratio et institutio studiorum
Societatis Jesu</i> of Claudius of Aquaviva. Following
that, they distinguished two courses of teaching,
a higher and a lower. The lower included
nothing but an external knowledge of the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
language, and some fortuitous knowledge of history,
of antiquities, and of mythology. <i>The
memory was cultivated as a means of keeping
down free activity of thought and clearness of
judgment.</i> The higher course comprehended dialectics,
rhetoric, physics, and morals. Dialectics
was expounded as the art of sophistry. In rhetoric,
they favored the polemical and emphatic style
of the African Fathers of the church and their
gorgeous phraseology; in physics, they followed
Aristotle closely, and especially encouraged reading
of the books ‘De Generatione et Corruptione’ and
‘De Coelo,’ on which they commented after their
fashion; finally, in morals, casuistic skepticism was
their central point. They made much of rhetoric,
on account of their sermons, giving to it careful
attention. They laid stress on declamation, and
introduced it into their showy public examinations
through the performance of Latin school comedies,
and thus amused the public, disposed them to
approval, and at the same time quite innocently
practiced the pupil in the art of assuming a feigned
character.</p>

<p>“Diplomatic conduct was made necessary to the
pupils of the Jesuits, as well by their strict military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
discipline as by their system of mutual distrust,
espionage, and informing. Implicit obedience
relieved the pupils from all responsibility as to the
moral justification of their deeds. This exact following
out of all commands and refraining from
any criticism as to principles, created a moral
indifference; and, from the necessity of having
consideration for the peculiarities and caprices of
the superior on whom all others were dependent,
arose eye service. The coolness of mutual distrust
sprang from the necessity which each felt of
being on his guard against every other as a talebearer.
The most deliberate hypocrisy and pleasure
in intrigue merely for the sake of intrigue—this
subtilest poison of moral corruption—were
the result. Jesuitism had not only an interest in
the material profit, which, when it had corrupted
souls, fell to its share, but it also had an interest
in the educative process of corruption. With
absolute indifference as to the idea of morality
... or the moral quality of the means used to
attain its end, it rejoiced in the efficacy of secrecy,
and the accomplished and calculating understanding,
and in deceiving the credulous by means of its
graceful, seemingly scrupulous, moral language.”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of

<p>Here is a picture of <i>this papacy of the
papacy</i>. Again I say, had Protestantism
remained true to principle, even this
system could not have accomplished its
overthrow; but since truth was neglected by Protestant
schools, this system of the Jesuits easily
carried every country into which it was introduced.
“The Jesuit system of education ... was intended
to meet the active influence of Protestantism
in education. It was remarkably successful,
and for a century [following 1584] nearly all
the foremost men of Christendom came from
Jesuit schools. In 1710 they had six hundred
and twelve colleges, one hundred and fifty-seven
normal schools, twenty-four universities, and an
immense number of lower schools. These schools
laid very great stress on <i>emulation</i>. Their experiments
in this principle are so extensive and long-continued
that they furnish a most valuable phase
in the history of pedagogy in this respect alone.
In the matter of supervision they are also worthy
of study. They had a fivefold system, each subordinate
being obedient to his superior. Besides
this, there was a complete system of espionage
on the part of the teachers and pupil monitors.”<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Methods of
Jesuitical
schools</div>

<p>On the subject of emulation, as made
use of in the schools of the Jesuits,
Painter gives us these thoughts: “The
Jesuits made much of emulation, and in
their eager desire to promote it they adopted
means that could not fail to excite jealousy and
envy. Says the Plan of Studies: ‘He who knows
how to excite emulation has found the most powerful
auxiliary in his teaching. Let the teacher,
then, highly appreciate this valuable aid, and let
him study to make the wisest use of it. Emulation
awakens and develops all the powers of man. In
order to maintain emulation, it will be necessary
that each pupil have a rival to control his conduct
and criticise him; also magistrates, questors, censors,
and decurians should be appointed among the
students. Nothing will be held more honorable
than to outstrip a fellow student, and nothing
more dishonorable than to be outstripped. Prizes
will be distributed to the best pupils with the
greatest possible solemnity. Out of school the
place of honor will everywhere be given to the
most distinguished pupils.’”<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>As the Colossus of Rhodes stood astride the
Greek waters, so the Jesuit schools spanned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
gulf of education. One foot stood in Greece
amidst its classics (for “Aristotle furnished the
leading text-books”), the other on Christian soil,
having the <i>form</i> of godliness; but like the demigods
of Greece, it was neither human nor divine. The
results of the educational system of the Jesuits
are well summed up in another paragraph from
Painter:—</p>

<p>“The Jesuit system of education, based not
upon a study of man, but upon the interests of the
order, was necessarily narrow. It sought showy
results with which to dazzle the world. A well-rounded
development was nothing. The principle
of authority, suppressing all freedom and independence
of thought, prevailed from beginning to end.
Religious pride and intolerance were fostered.
While our baser feelings were highly stimulated,
the nobler side of our nature was wholly neglected.
Love of country, fidelity to friends, nobleness of
character, enthusiasm for beautiful ideals, were
insidiously suppressed. For the rest, we adopt
the language of Quick: ‘The Jesuits did not aim at
developing <i>all</i> the faculties of their pupils, but
merely the receptive and reproductive faculties.
When the young man had acquired a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
mastery of the Latin language for all purposes;
when he was well versed in the theological and
philosophical opinions of his preceptors; when he
was skillful in dispute, and could make a brilliant
display from the resources of a well-stored memory,
he had reached the highest points to which the Jesuits
sought to lead him. Originality and independence
of mind, love of truth for its own sake, the
power of reflecting and of forming correct judgments,
were not merely neglected, they were suppressed
in the Jesuits’ system. But in what they
attempted they were eminently successful, and
their success went a long way toward securing their
popularity.’”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wherein
Jesuit
schools
worthy
of imitation</div>

<p>One can not condemn without reserve
the Jesuitical system of education; for
all false systems contain some points of
truth, and the strength of all these systems
lies in their close counterfeit of the
true. Hence we can agree with these
words: “Whatever its defects as a system of general
education, it was admirably suited to Jesuit purposes,
and in some particulars it embodied valuable
principles.” As the progress of the papacy through
the Jesuitical schools is followed into one country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and then another, one admires the constancy and
self-sacrifice of those who have committed their
lives to the order. Had Protestants been one half
as diligent in advocating the principles of Christian
education as the Jesuit teachers have been in counteracting
the influence of the Reformation, far different
results would to-day be seen in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread
of Jesuit
schools</div>

<p>In tracing the growth of the schools of
the Jesuits we begin with Germany, the
heart of the reform movement, and follow
quite carefully the history as given
by Ranke: “Bishop Urban became acquainted
with Le Jay and heard from him, for the first
time, of the <i>colleges</i> the <i>Jesuits had founded in
several universities</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuit college
in
Vienna</div>

<p>“Upon this the bishop advised his imperial
master [Ferdinand I] to found a
<i>similar college in Vienna</i>, seeing how
great was the decay of Catholic theology
in Germany. Ferdinand warmly embraced the
suggestion; in a letter he wrote to Loyola on the
subject, he declares his conviction that the only
<i>means to uphold the declining cause of Catholicism
in Germany, was to give the rising generation
learned and pious Catholics for teachers</i>.” We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
can understand the grounds for this decision
when we recall the statement that about 1563
it was said that “twenty years had elapsed in
Vienna since a single student of the university
had taken priest’s orders.” “The preliminaries,”
says Ranke, “were easily arranged. In the year
1551 thirteen Jesuits, among them Le Jay himself,
arrived in Vienna, and were in the first
instance, granted a dwelling, chapel, and pension,
by Ferdinand, until shortly after he incorporated
them with the university, and even
assigned to them the visitation of it.” “Soon after
this they arose to consideration in <i>Cologne</i>,” but
for a time had little success. In 1556 the endowed
school referred to before governed by a Protestant
regent, “gave them an opportunity of gaining a
firmer footing. For since there was a party in the
city bent above all things on maintaining the Catholic
character of the university, the advice given
by the patrons of the Jesuits to hand over the
establishment to that order, met with attention.”
“At the same period they also gained a firm footing
in <i>Ingoldstadt</i>.” “From these three metropolitan
centers the Jesuits now spread out in every
direction.” These schools were, some of them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
least, training schools for Catholic teachers; for
Ranke tells of a certain man in Hungary, Olahus
by name, and dedicated in infancy to the church,
who, “contemplating the general decay of Catholicism
in Hungary, saw that the last hope left for it
was that of maintaining its hold on the common
people, who had not yet wholly lapsed from its
rule. To this end, however, there lacked teachers
of Catholic principles, and to form whom, he
founded a college of Jesuits at Tyrnau in the year
1561.” “Two privy councilors of the elector
Daniel, of Mainz, ... conceived likewise that the
<i>admission of the Jesuits was the only means that
promised a recovery of the University of Mainz</i>.
In spite of the opposition made by the canons and
feudal proprietors, they founded a college of the
order in Mainz, and a preparatory school in
Aschaffenburg.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">School at
Heidelberg</div>

<p>The Jesuits advanced up the Rhine.
“They particularly coveted a settlement
at Spires, both because ... there were
so many distinguished men [assembled there] over
whom it would be of extraordinary moment to
possess influence; and also in order to be placed
near the Heidelberg University, which at that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
enjoyed the highest repute for its Protestant professors.
They gradually carried their point.” It
is interesting to note how they shadowed the
Protestant schools, as if, like a parasite, to suck
from them their life. “In order to bring back
his University of Dillingen to its original purpose,
Cardinal Truchess resolved to dismiss all
the professors who still taught there, and to commit
the establishment entirely to the Jesuits.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rapid
growth of
Jesuit
schools</div>

<p>To show the rapidity with which the
Jesuits worked, Ranke says: “In the
year 1551 they had not yet any fixed
position in Germany;” “in 1556 they
had extended over Bavaria and the Tyrol, Franconia,
and Swabia, a great part of Rhineland, and
Austria, and they had penetrated into Hungary,
Bohemia, and Moravia.” True to the purpose of
the order, “their labors were above all devoted
to the universities. They were ambitious of rivaling
the fame of those of the Protestants.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuits’
preparatory
schools</div>

<p>“The Jesuits displayed no less assiduity
in the conduct of their Latin schools.
It was one of the leading maxims of
Lainez that the lower grammatical
classes should be supplied with good teachers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
since first impressions exercise the greatest influence
over the whole future life of the individual.”
The Jesuits were willing to devote a lifetime
to one phase of education. “It was found that
young persons learned more under them in half a
year than with others in two years; even Protestants
called back their children from distant
schools, and put them under the care of the
Jesuits.” From this last sentence two things are
to be observed. Protestants had lost sight of the
importance of education, and their schools had
greatly deteriorated, else they would not have
intrusted their children to the Jesuits. While the
Jesuits began by working into the universities,
“schools for the poor, modes of instruction
adapted for children, and catechizing followed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reputation
of Jesuit
schools</div>

<p>“The instruction of the Jesuits was
conveyed wholly in the spirit of that
enthusiastic devotion which had from
the first so peculiarly characterized their
order.” This had its effect; for earnest, whole-hearted
work on the part of the teacher, even
though the methods may be wrong and material
false, will surely react in the lives of the pupils.
Viewing the work of Jesuit teachers, one feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to exclaim, “Since thou art so noble, I would
thou wert on our side!” And so “erelong the
children, who frequented the schools of the
Jesuits in Vienna, were distinguished for their
resolute refusal to partake on fast days of forbidden
meats which their parents ate.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuits
conquered
Germany
by their

<p>Teachers had more weight with the
children than the parents themselves,
and became leaders of the older members
of the family, so that “the feelings
thus engendered in the schools were
propagated throughout the mass of the population
by preaching and confession.”</p>

<p>The final results in Germany, Ranke gives thus:
“They occupied the professors’ chairs, and found
pupils who attached themselves to their doctrines....
<i>They conquered the Germans on their own
soil, in their very home, and wrested from them
a part of their native land.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> So much for
Germany and its Jesuit schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuit
schools
in France</div>

<p>Concerning the capture of France by the
Jesuits it is not necessary to say much.
Ranke gives a few strong paragraphs,
showing the work of the order as teachers.
The Protestants of France made a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
mistake, and brought their cause into disrepute,
especially in Paris, by taking up arms in a time
of commotion, and Ranke says: “Backed by
this state of public feeling, the Jesuits established
themselves in France. They began there on a
somewhat small scale, being constrained to content
themselves with colleges thrown open to them
by a few ecclesiastics.... They encountered at
first the most obstinate resistance in the great
cities, especially in Paris, ... but they at last
forced their way through all impediments, and
were admitted in the year 1564 to the privilege
of teaching. Lyons had already received them.
Whether it was the result of good fortune or of
merit, they were enabled at once to produce some
men of brilliant talents from amongst them....
In Lyons, especially, the Huguenots were completely
routed, their preachers exiled, their
churches demolished, and their books burned;
whilst, on the other hand, a splendid college was
erected for the Jesuits in 1567. They had also a
distinguished professor, whose exposition of the
Bible attracted <i>crowds of charmed and attentive
youth</i>. From these chief towns they now spread
over the kingdom in every direction.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the influence gained as educators, 3,800 copies
of Angier’s Catechism were sold in the space of
eight years in Paris alone. France no longer
<i>leaned</i> toward Protestantism. She had been regained
by the Jesuit schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuitical
schools in
England</div>

<p>Concerning the work in England, more
is said, and our own connection with that
kingdom adds weight in our eyes to
the history of her education. Thompson
says: “During the reign of Elizabeth the
papal authorities renewed their exertions to put
a stop to Protestantism in England, and sent
more Jesuits there for that purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> What
they could not accomplish through intrigue and
civil policy they were more sure to gain through
the schools; hence Thompson says: “They accomplished
one thing, which was to carry away
with them several young English noblemen, to be
educated by the Jesuits in Flanders, so as to fit
them for treason against their own country,—repeating
in this the experiment Loyola had made in
Germany.... The Jesuits endeavored to become
the educators of English youths as they had those
of Germany.... The pope therefore established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
an English college at <i>Rome</i>, to educate young
Englishmen.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
college at
Rome</div>

<p>Of this college, Ranke tells us further:
“William Allen first conceived the idea
of uniting the young English Catholics
who resided on the continent for the
prosecution of their studies, and, chiefly through
the support of Pope Gregory, he established a
college for them at Douay. This, however, did
not seem to the pope to be adequate for the
purpose in view. He wished to provide for those
fugitives under his own eyes a more tranquil and
less dangerous retreat than could be found in the
disturbed Netherlands; accordingly he founded an
English college in Rome, and consigned it to the
care of the Jesuits. No one was admitted into the
college who did not pledge himself, on the completion
of his studies, to return to England, and to
preach there the faith of the Roman Church.”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuits as
teachers in
America</div>

<p>America was settled when the Jesuit
power was at its height. Those teachers
who penetrated Germany without fear,
and secretly stole into England when it
was unsafe for them to be identified, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
closely the paths of discovery and settlement. “In
the beginning of the seventeenth century we find,”
says Ranke, “the stately fabric of the Catholic
Church in South America fully reared.... The
Jesuits taught grammar and the liberal arts, and a
theological seminary was connected with their college
of San Ildefonso. All branches of theological
study were taught in the universities of Mexico
and Lima.”<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesuits in
the United
States</div>

<p>In North America their vigilance was no
less marked. “In 1611 Jesuit missionaries
came over and labored with
remarkable zeal and success in converting
the Indians.”<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In Maryland, a Catholic
colony from the first, they held unbounded sway.
Speaking of the time of Lord Baltimore, Thompson
says: “At that time, in England, the papists
were chiefly under the influence of the Jesuits,
whose vigilance was too sleepless to permit the
opportunity of planting their society in the New
World to escape them.”<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Their work has been
quietly done from the very first, and some think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that because of the papal decree of 1773, suppressing
the order, they have ceased their work. This,
however, is a mistake; for “Gregory XVI, whose
pontificate commenced in 1831, was the first pope
who seemed encouraged by the idea that the
papacy would ultimately establish itself in the
United States. His chief reliance, as the means
of realizing this hope, was upon the <i>Jesuits</i>, upon
whose entire devotion to the principles of absolutism
he could confidently rely.”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> But the Jesuits
always accomplish their work largely by means of
education, hence we may look for them to use the
same tactics in our country that had proved so
eminently successful to their cause in England and
Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object of
Jesuit
schools in
America</div>

<p>“The chief thing with the Jesuits,” as
Gressinger writes, “was to obtain the
sole direction of education, so that by
getting the young into their hands, they
could fashion them after their own pattern.” It
has been the avowed aim of the Jesuits to stamp
out Protestantism, and with this, republicanism.
In this country, where these two principles were
pre-eminently conspicuous, and so closely associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that whatever kills one kills the other, it is
doubly true that by gaining control of the educational
system the order could work for the papacy
the utter ruin of America, both from a religious
and a civil standpoint. From the dawn of our history
there has been within our borders, mingling
with our loyal citizens, a class of educators who
carry out this principle described by Thompson.
“The Roman Catholic youth are forbidden by the
papal system from accepting as true the principles
of the Declaration of Independence or of the Constitution
of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Leo XIII, who
was educated a Jesuit [Thompson], remains true to
his principles. His biographer says “that the
‘false education’ and ‘antichristian training’ of
the young which prevail in the United States and
among the liberal and progressive peoples of the
world must be done away with, abandoned, and
‘Thomas Aquinnas [a Catholic of the thirteenth
century] must once more be enthroned as the
“angel of the schools;” his methods and doctrines
must be the light of all higher teaching, for his
works are only revealed truth set before the human
mind in its most scientific form.’”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress
of papal
principles</div>

<p>It is unnecessary to state the number of
schools established by Catholics in the
United States, which have been placed
under the control of the Jesuits; neither
is it necessary to trace the attempts which have
been made by the papacy, at irregular periods in
our history, to obtain the control of our public
school system. The affairs at Stillwater, Minn.,
and at Farabault, in the same State, while unsuccessful,
were weather vanes showing the direction
of the wind,—were posers to test the public
pulse, and just so surely show the policy of the
papacy in educational matters. Of far greater
importance to us as Protestants is the fact that
<i>Jesuitical principles may and do prevail in our
popular system of education</i>, and these principles,
whether carried out by Jesuits, or by the ordinary
teacher who is unconscious of her situation, and
unmindful of the result of her methods, bring
about the fall of Protestantism and republicanism.
Our nation has repudiated her foundation principles;
are our Protestant churches doing likewise?
The history of the educational institutions of the
United States, which are discussed in the next chapters,
will show how the plan of work now followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in our universities, colleges, and schools of lower
grades, are patterning after Sturm, and how they
go farther back, connecting the twentieth century
with the scholasticism of the Middle Ages. It is
without the slightest feelings of animosity toward
the Jesuits or the papacy that these facts are
traced. These both do for their cause what will
best serve to upbuild it. Their methods, in so far
as they accomplish their desired end, are to be
commended, and their zeal is ever to be admired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An educational
question
for Protestants</div>

<p>The one problem for Protestants to
solve is whether to accept Jesuitical,
papal education, and thus become
papal, forming “an image to the
Beast,”—to use the language of the
Apocalypse,—or whether they will follow the principles
of Christian education, and remain true to
the name <span class="smcap">Protestant</span>. Let the reader forget
the names; but let him remember that there are
but two <i>principles</i> in the world, when the standard
of eternal truth is recognized; one exalts
Christ, and gives life everlasting; the other exalts
man, and its life is for this world alone. Education
according to the second does, in its methods,
dwarf, enfeeble, and belittle. It puts stress upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the unimportant, and passes by truth without a
glance. It prepares the mind for absolutism both
in government and religion. Education according
to the first will be based upon methods which
develop, in every particular, the human being.
It is a mental, moral, and physical education, and
its object is so to educate that eventually each of
these three natures will assume the right relation
to the other two, and again, as on the Mount of
Transfiguration with the Son of God, “divinity
within will flash forth to meet divinity without.”</p>

<span class="smaller">AMERICA AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Protestantism and Republicanism, Born of
the Reformation, Nourished by Schools.</span>—As
if lifted from the bosom of the deep by the mighty
hand of God, America stood forth to receive the
principles of religious and civil freedom born of
the Reformation on German soil. To the German
government was first offered the opportunity
of developing to the full the reform movement.
This full and complete development would have
meant religious liberty for all, and a government
by the people,—Protestantism and republicanism.
These two systems go hand in hand, and are more
closely connected than any other principles in
existence. The death of one means the death of
the other, for the same life-blood nourishes both.</p>

<p>Germany started well. There were to be found
princes, liberal in mind and government, who
accepted the new religion, and stood by the
Reformers through all their storm-tossed career.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
God had raised up these men for the time and
place, as surely as he called Nebuchadnezzar, or
appointed a work for Cyrus. Protestantism was
firmly rooted, and, as we have already seen,
during the first forty years of its existence, so
strong was its vitality that men and nations bowed
before it. The early Reformers, especially Luther
and Melancthon, connected the movement with
the fountain of life when they introduced a system
of Christian education. And previous chapters
make plain the truth that the life of the entire
movement in its twofold aspect—Protestantism
and republicanism—depended upon a right educational
system. When the mass of German youth
sat at the feet of German teachers, and those
teachers were true to the principles of Christian
education, Roman influence dwindled, and her
very life was threatened. It was then that the
papacy itself took up the subject of education,
and by the work of the Jesuits succeeded in killing
the Reform in Germany,—indeed, in all
Europe.</p>

<p>“A day of great intellectual darkness has been
shown to be favorable to the success of popery.
It will yet be demonstrated that a day of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
intellectual light is equally favorable for its
success.”</p>

<p>The Jesuits planted schools of their own
in the shadow of Protestant schools;
they entered Protestant schools as teachers;
they sucked the life-blood from the
young child, and it faded and died.
The principles of the Reformation found honest
hearts in the Netherlands. The Dutch took up
the question of education; but the Jesuits were
again on the track, and, as Ranke says, “They
gradually carried their point.” The Reformation
crossed the Channel, to find the hearts of Englishmen
longing for greater freedom. Lollardism,
started by Wyclif two hundred years earlier, sprang
anew into life in the hearts of the Puritans, until,
in the reign of Henry VIII, more than one half of
the English population was Protestant. Finally
the Commonwealth was established.</p>

<div class="sidenote">England
loses her
golden
opportunity</div>

<p>To England was offered the opportunity
of showing to the world the perfect
fruits of the Reformation in its Protestant
religion and a republican government.
But alas! the story is repeated.
English youth fell into the hands of Jesuits. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
English college was founded at Rome, and teachers,
ministers, and canvassers returned to their
native land with the avowed purpose of their educators,
the Jesuits, to overthrow the Reformation.
And England fell!</p>

<p>Those familiar words from the pen of Luther,
which appear in his letter appealing for aid in the
establishment of Protestant schools, echo through
England also: “The Word of God and His grace
are like a shower that falls, and passes away. It
was among the Jews; but it passed away, and now
they have it no longer. Paul carried it to Greece;
but in that country also it has passed away, and
the Turk reigns there now. It came to Rome and
the Latin empire; but there also it has passed
away, and Rome now has the pope. O, Germans,
do not expect to have this Word forever!”
Could this man of God have come forth from his
grave a century later, and have looked over his
loved Germany, and over England, he would have
added these names to those of the countries where
God’s Word and His grace had been, but had
passed away. Must the name of America be
added to the above list? May Protestants be
aroused before it is too late!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Puritan
exodus</div>

<p>Finding that England closed her doors
against progress, the Puritans sought
greater freedom in the Netherlands.
They were disappointed, for they could
not there educate their children as Protestantism
taught them that they should be educated. As
Pilgrims they sought new homes in America, finding
a retreat on the bleak shores of New England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism
reaches
America</div>

<p>It is now our duty to trace the growth
and decline of Protestantism in our own
land. <i>Its prosperity in every other
country has been in proportion to its
adherence to the correct principles of education;
its decline has without exception been the result of
a wrong system of education.</i> How is it in the
United States?</p>

<p>No student of history, and especially of prophetic
history, doubts for a moment that the way
was divinely prepared for Protestantism to cross
the Atlantic, and it is equally as evident that
that same Hand was upholding those principles
after they reached these shores. God’s Word
spoke often to the hearts of men, leading them to
devise plans, pass laws, establish institutions, and
in various ways to so work that His truths might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
here grow to a perfection which they never
reached in the old country. On the other hand,
those teachings which have frustrated the principles
of Protestantism in Europe are seen to be at
work in America from the first planting of a colony
until the present day. That strength-producing
element was <i>Christian education;</i> that counteracting
influence was <i>false</i> or <i>papal education</i>.
These two form the subject of this chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Educational
History
of the
United
States</div>

<p>United States history is interwoven with
the history of education. Her founders,
especially of the New England colonies,
traced their origin to an educational
center in England, and as early New
England history circles about Harvard, so the
fathers and supporters of that institution traced
their origin in Old England to the counties of East
Anglia, where Cambridge University bore sway.
“Of the first six hundred who landed in Massachusetts,
one in thirty, it is said, was a graduate
of the English Cambridge. These and their companions
were rare men. They had the schooling
for a service the like of whose execution, in completeness
and good sense, the world has never
equaled.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“With matchless wisdom they joined liberty
and learning in a perpetual and holy alliance,
binding the latter to bless every child with instruction,
which the former invests with the rights
and duties of citizenship. They made education
and sovereignty co-extensive, by making both
universal.”<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>John Fiske enlarges upon this thought.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The
“greater hospitality of Cambridge [University,
England] toward new ideas” is proverbial, and the
very names, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, and
Essex, Cambridge and Huntingdon, familiar in the
geography of New England, are telling a story of
Protestant education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Radical
and Conservative
Puritans</div>

<p>Strong as the Puritans seemed in denouncing
the Church of Rome, and in
accepting Protestantism, which, at the
beginning of the seventeenth century,
more than ever before, meant separation from the
established church and the established forms of
government, they were not united in thought.
There were two classes: Puritans, and a class of
this class represented by such men as Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Hooker. Of the Puritans, Fiske says: “Some
would have stopped short with Presbyterianism,
while others held that ‘new presbyter was but old
priest writ large,’ and so pressed on to Independency.”<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
This difference of opinion on religious
matters is discernible when representatives of both
classes, mingling in the society about Boston,
started the educational work of America. Those
inclined to remain under the banner of Presbyterianism
taunted the others, who were known as
Brownists, or Separatists, and who followed William
Brewster to America, with <i>anarchy</i>, merely
because they believed in carrying out fully the
principles for which all were ready to fight.</p>

<p>Thus from the first has our educational work
fallen into the hands of two classes of men,—a
class willing to compromise in order to keep peace,
and a bold, daring class, who advocated stepping
out on truth regardless of what might follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Congregationalism
and education</div>

<p>There was a mighty educational problem
before the church. The Episcopalians
had failed to take up that work in England;
it was from their midst that Wm.
Brewster, a Cambridge graduate, John Robinson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
who also was graduated from Cambridge in 1600,
and William Bradford, afterward governor of
Plymouth for thirty years, withdrew to form the
nucleus of the Congregational Church, which
had its origin at Scrooby, England, and ended
in Plymouth. What Episcopalianism had overlooked
in the matter of education in England it
now became the duty and privilege of the new
church to begin on the virgin soil of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New
England
theocracy</div>

<p>The reader is familiar with the fact that
the Puritans, leaving England because
of civil and religious oppression, the
result of a union of church and state,
came to America for freedom, and, contrary to
what one would expect, especially at a casual
glance, they here developed a theocracy. “The
aim of Winthrop and his friends in coming to
Massachusetts was the construction of a theocratic
state which should be to Christians ... all that
the theocracy of Moses and Joshua and Samuel
had been to the Jews.... In such a scheme
there was no room for religious liberty.... The
state they were to found was to consist of a
united body of believers; citizenship itself was to
be co-extensive with church membership.”<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Educational
work
breaks the
theocracy</div>

<p>It is equally well known, however, that
this theocratic form was soon broken;
and while the United States is beginning
to find herself again approaching this
mode of government, it is a remarkable
fact, and one well worthy of our closest consideration,
that <i>the ancient theocracy of New England
was broken by the power of the educational
system</i> there introduced. When this is read from
the pages that follow, let the reader answer the
question whether or not the <i>repudiation of Protestant
principles and the principles of republicanism
by the United States in the nineteenth
century is equally due to the present system</i>.
Bear in mind the question as we proceed.</p>

<p>The educational history of the United States
may conveniently be studied in three sections; 1,
colonial; 2, revolutionary; 3, nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Colonial Period.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The founding
of
Harvard</div>

<p>Since Harvard College, the American
Cambridge, “accomplished,” as Boone
says, “a much needed work, with
manifold wholesome reactions upon society
and government, so that it has been affirmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
with show of truth, that ‘the founding of Harvard
College hastened the Revolution half a century,’”<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
our study of the schools of the colonial period will
center around this institution. It can be stated
with safety that the history of Harvard, its leading
men, and its varying attitude toward different
Colonial problems, throws light on the development
of the question of education at the time
when the foundations of our national government
were laid.</p>

<p>When Boston was but six years old, plans
were laid for America’s first college. “Among
the early educational leaders,” says Boone, “were
such men as the Rev. Thomas Shepherd, John
Cotton, and John Wilson, Jr.; all clergymen and
all college-bred; Stoughton; Dudley, the deputy-governor,
and, above all, ‘Winthrop, the governor,
the guide and good genius of the colony.’
Such were the men ... of the infant colony....
Here were learning and character; world-wisdom
and refinements of heart; breadth and
wholeness of culture, such as could alone justify
the boldness of their attempt.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
was started in poverty, four hundred pounds being
voted by the people. The high motive which
prompted the enterprise was “an unbounded zeal
for an education, that to them seemed not so much
desirable as necessary, <i>that ‘the light of learning
might not go out, nor the study of God’s Word
perish</i>.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object of
Harvard to
train ministers</div>

<p>The object of the school, as held by the
founders, is well described by a Boston
citizen, who writes thus in 1643 to some
of his friends: “After we had builded
our houses, provided necessaries for our livelihood,
reared convenient places for worship, and
settled the civil government, one of the next
things we longed for and looked after was to
advance learning and to perpetuate it to posterity,
dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to
the churches, when our present ministers shall
lie in the dust. And as we were thinking and
consulting how to effect this great work, it pleased
God to stir up the heart of one Mr. Howard (a
godly gentleman and a lover of learning, then
living among us) to give the one half of his estate
... toward the erecting of a College, and all
his library.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>In the contemplation of a college by those
noble men, the uppermost thought was <i>how to
gain an educated ministry</i>. This object was lost
sight of.</p>

<p>“It must be remembered,” writes Boone, “that
for sixty years the institution was little more
than a <i>training-school for ministers</i>, managed as
a theological seminary, having religion, of a more
or less well-defined type, as its basis and chief
object. Yet, as Professor Emerson has put it,
‘It is one of the most remarkable things in the
history of Harvard, that, in all the constitutions
of the college there is <i>nothing illiberal or sectarian</i>;
<i>nothing to check the freest pursuit of
truth in theological opinions, and in everything
else</i>; and this, too, while the founders of the
college were severely and strictly orthodox, often
exclusive in their own opinions, and while their
object was unquestionably to provide for the thorough
education of ministers of the gospel in like
views with themselves.’” “The very foundation
idea of the college,” says Boone, in another paragraph,
“was the theological want.”</p>

<p>“The presidents and members of the corporation
were generally the prominent scholars, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
theologians, and the political leaders of the community
and time. The college easily came to be
the arena upon which, or the interest about which,
were fought those terrible logomachies of dogma
and doctrine. These required, as they had, the
best learning, the shrewdest insight, the most
politic minds of the day.”</p>

<p>This perhaps explains that former statement,
that the education of ministers by Harvard had
more than anything else to do with the overthrow
of the theocracy established about Boston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A manifest
spirit
of democracy</div>

<p>It is interesting, also, to note the spirit
of democracy which this institution fostered.
In speaking of the raising of the
fund for erecting the building, Boone
says: “The colony caught his [Mr. Harvard’s]
spirit, ... and all did something, even the indigent.
One subscribed a number of sheep; another,
nine shillings’ worth of cloth; one, a
ten-shilling pewter flagon; others, a fruit-dish, a
sugar-spoon, a silver-tipped jug, etc.... No
rank, no class of men, is unrepresented. The
school was of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> “It was nursed
by democracy,” and it in turn nursed democracy.
Surely the Spirit of God was pleading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
with men so to arrange their leading educational
institution that the principles of the Reformation
might be perpetuated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
course of
study in
Harvard</div>

<p>The course of study for this ministers’
school, as described by Emerson, was
remarkably free from sectarianism, and
liberal in thought. “The Bible was
systematically studied for the entire three years,
Ezra, Daniel, and the New Testament being specified.
A year was given to catechetical divinity.”<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Students were required to attend worship twice
daily, when the Scriptures were read in Hebrew
or Greek, and they were required to translate
the selection. History received some attention,
but the sciences were practically unknown, and
“all profane literature was excluded.”</p>

<p>Through all this is discernible the attempt to
educate for the cause of Christ. With this beginning,
what might have been accomplished had
the plan, with truth unadulterated, been followed!
The work done in later days by the schools, under
the direction of the State, is but an indication of
the broad field which lay ahead of Harvard and
similar institutions, <i>had the church remained in
her province as the educator of her own children</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indications
of papal
principles</div>

<p>From the very foundation of Harvard
may be seen indications that there was
alongside of these principles of Christian
education somewhat of medieval teaching,
which, unless discovered and banished would
act as leaven, permeating the whole loaf. For
instance, when the college was less than twenty
years old, we find this requirement for admission
announced: “When any scholar is able to read
Tully or any like classical Latin author, <i>ex tempore</i>,
and make and speak true Latin in verse and
prose, and define perfectly the paradigms of nouns
and verbs in the Greek tongue, then may he be
admitted to the College; nor shall any claim
admission before such qualifications.” This, of
course, was patterning after the European universities,
and theirs was a papal system.</p>

<p>This was the Harvard of colonial times. As we
enter the Revolutionary period, we may look for
changes as the result of both the correct and the
incorrect principles harbored. Is Harvard, with
all her wonderful facilities, training as many for
gospel service to-day as she did of old? Yale,
the second Congregational school, followed closely
the plans and object of Harvard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
in Virginia
monarchical</div>

<p>William and Mary, the second college in
the United States, was founded under
different circumstances. It was born in
the midst of wealth, and was befriended
by cavaliers and courtiers. “The roots,” says
Boone, “were deep in the great English ecclesiastical
system,” and yet the avowed object was
“that the college, when established, should be a
‘seminary for the breeding of good ministers.’”
Notwithstanding good intentions, it mixed scholastic
teachings; for it stood for “the Oxford order
of humanities; the <i>abstract</i> as the foundation of
the concrete; everything for discipline; the ancient
languages before the modern.” Jefferson was a
graduate of this school, and later it will be seen
how this man, whose mind comprehended so clearly
the principles of religious liberty, strove to break
away from this mixture in education, and advocated
a decidedly secular education in schools
which were supported by the State, thereby avoiding
in such institutions the mixture of secular and
religious training.</p>

<p>So far, we see the Episcopal school, William
and Mary, deeply rooted in the English ecclesiastical
system, and unable to receive the Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
principles of education pure and simple. The
two Congregational schools, Harvard and Yale,
approached more nearly the Protestant ideal, but
being unable to break wholly the bond of scholasticism,
they made much of preparatory work
in the classics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
problems
of
Colonial
days</div>

<p>Some or the educational problems with
which our Colonial Fathers had to
wrestle were “parental responsibility,
the general viciousness of indolence, the
educative office of labor, the State’s
relation to individual need, compulsory employment
and schooling, the state ownership of child-life,”
and above all, and including all, the relation
the church sustained to the schools, how far secular
education could be offered in Christian schools,
and how far the church could ask aid of the state
in the conduct of church schools. They were
weighty questions upon which hung, and still
hangs, the destiny of a nation.</p>

<p>No sharp dividing line can be drawn between
the Colonial and the Revolutionary periods. The
work begun in the Colonial period prepared men
to act a noble part in the Revolutionary period.
The <i>truth</i> of the educational system would bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
fruit, but the error which we have already noticed
was in great danger of gaining strength enough to
choke the pure principles. Mere accusations
amount to but little. Let it suffice to follow the
history of educational progress through the next
century. Results speak for themselves.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Revolutionary Period.</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">Founding
preparatory
schools</div>

<p>In addition to the instruction given by
pious Puritan parents to the flock in
their own homes, a limited number of
common or church schools was established
in the Colonial period. The position of
academies, as they develop in the Revolutionary
period, is significant. We find that “alongside
each of the first colleges, frequently antedating
them, sometimes forming part of the organization,
was a grammar-school.”</p>

<p>Such schools, attached to Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
William and Mary’s, and others, prepared
for the universities, and supplemented the work
of the elementary or common schools. Herein
lay a vital point. They had home schools, elementary
schools, and colleges. It was impossible
for these elementary schools to fit students for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
university life when such schools required for
entrance that the student should “read Tully or
any like classical Latin author <i>ex tempore</i>, and
make and speak true Latin in verse and prose,
and decline perfectly the paradigms of nouns and
verbs in the Greek tongue,” as has already been
quoted from an early Harvard announcement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The universities
demanded
classics</div>

<p>The universities founded by the church
were, then, forming a course of study
for these grammar schools, or academies,
as they were soon called; and
since the demand was for a classical preparatory
school, naturally their courses were “fitted to the
time-sanctioned curriculum of the college. They
taught much Latin and Greek, an extended course
in mathematics, and were strong generally on the
side of the humanities.” This was a modeling
after Rugby, Eton, and other noted English
schools, or the classical drill-schools of Germany,
which, as we have before seen, were
schools bearing decided marks of Jesuit teaching.</p>

<p>Should a young man care to pursue his studies
beyond the elementary school, his only opportunity
to do so was in one of the academies,
where the classics formed the sum and substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of the instruction. The tendency to revert
to the established forms of European education,
or the papal system, is plainly visible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Footprints
of the
papal
education</div>

<p>The first colleges had been planted to
give a Christian training, and doubtless
had a start which might have resulted
in the greatest strength to the church,
and to the nation in a secondary way; but the
introduction of these grammar schools or academies,
with a course of study in the <i>classics</i> made
necessary by the universities, threw the majority
of the young people into a <i>classical instead of a
practical line of instruction</i>. Looking at it from
one standpoint, no wiser move could have been
made to turn the tide of educational reform again
toward papal education. Can we here trace the
footprints of the Jesuits, whose policy since the
days of Loyola had been to overthrow Protestantism
by a false system of education?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestantism
and
republicanism
weakened</div>

<p>The effect of the mixture of the pure
and the impure methods, traceable in
indistinct lines at the very beginning,
now assumed more definite proportions.
The growth of academies was remarkably
rapid, and when attention is called to such men as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Franklin, the Adamses, John Hancock, and the
generation of “’76,” who received most of their
education in these schools, it may seem like sheer
presumption to condemn their work. The results,
however, as seen in later years, warrant the charge
that at that time was taken a long step from the
principles of the Reformation, which meant to this
country a weakening both in Protestantism and
republicanism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Union of
Christian
and papal
systems</div>

<p>These academies were denominational,
it is true; still they offered this prescribed
course of instruction. Almost immediately
appear signs of the result of this
union of Christian education with scholasticism.
For instance, we read that “Brown University,
though founded as a Baptist institution, was nevertheless
one of the first schools of the period to
emphasize the growing sentiment for a thoroughly
undenominational collegiate training.” Why should
a denominational college give an undenominational
course of instruction, and why, above all denominations,
should the Baptists do so, to whom such a
flood of light had come, and who always with pride
pointed back to Roger Williams and the State of
Rhode Island as the ancestors and embodiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of all that is Protestant and republican? But
this is not the only indication of this decline
from early principles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harvard
loses sight
of original
object</div>

<p>About 1793 Harvard assumed the name
of university. Boone says, “Signs of
Catholicity also appear, in that students
were no longer required to attend the
divinity lectures, except they were preparing for
the ministry.... Literary societies, voluntary
associations for social and general culture, were
multiplied.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decline in
other
schools</div>

<p>“The first Greek fraternity,—the Phi
Beta Kappa,—the parent of both secret
and open college fraternity organizations
of America,” was formed at William and
Mary in 1776. This is another indication of the
stealthy introduction of principles opposed to
democracy, and which tend to break existing
prejudice against the secret organizations of the
papacy.</p>

<p>Again, “Yale, also, though nominally on a
Congregational foundation, received aid (1792)
from the state, and gave place in her corporation
to state representatives.” Educational apostasy
was beginning; religious decline must follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Schools
ask state
support</div>

<p>Boone gives another paragraph, which,
in a few words, tells a story of much
significance, more, perhaps, than the
author realized; for he was merely chronicling
the history of education, not searching for
the philosophy thereof. He says, “The college,
once an appendage to the church, was seen, in
view of imminent state dangers, to have an equal
value to the Commonwealth.” This, of course,
is true, because the Commonwealth depended for
support, for very existence, upon the educational
ideas propagated in its schools. But the writer
continues: “First encouraged because it provided
an educated ministry, there was coming to be
recognized an opinion, despite the deficiencies in
culture, that education is something more—that
it has a value in itself; that schools might well be
maintained apart from the church as an organization,
and in no way lessen their usefulness.”<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Here was the challenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
belongs
to the
church</div>

<p>God has placed in the hands of his
church the right and privilege to educate
the young. In doing this, he has done
more; for in educating the youth, the
church stands at God’s right hand to guide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
nation into paths of rectitude. Not by joining
hands can this be done, for <i>church and state must,
in order each to be free, be forever separate</i>. Still
the pillar upon which the nation must stand, the
only one upon which it <i>can</i> stand, is <i>a true system
of education</i>, and this is a divine gift to the church,
which was born of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Church
fails in
educational
work</div>

<p>To the Lutheran Church the message
of education was preached by Luther.
The Episcopal Church received this
“word and grace of God,” as Luther
expresses it; but it passed from them,
and they returned to scholasticism. Oxford, Cambridge,
Eton, Rugby, all English schools testify to
this. The message passed on to the Congregational
Church, and Harvard, Yale, and others
started on the right road, but through the glories
of the world lost sight of their original object.
Harvard, founded to educate ministers, sent forth
in the year 1896, out of a class of four hundred
graduates only six ministers. The Presbyterian
Church had its opportunity, and likewise the Baptist
and the Methodist. Rapidly education, the
scepter with which America was to be ruled, was
slipping from the churches. “Of the four colleges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
established during the war, two were non-sectarian,
as were three fourths of the sixteen colleges
founded in the twenty years after 1776.”</p>

<p>A momentous time was reached. Not only
were the colonies to organize a government which
would astonish the world, but the people of these
colonies were on the verge of an educational precipice,
and mighty interests were hanging in the
balance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fruit
of the
classics</div>

<p>We have seen that from the classical
academies came forth the minds which,
for a generation or two, bore sway while
the nation passed its critical period.
There were the Adamses and Jefferson, Franklin,
Webster, De Witt Clinton, Horace Mann, Joseph
Henry, Everett, and Story; Guilford, of Ohio;
Grime, of South Carolina; Frelinghuysen, of New
Jersey; Wayland, in Rhode Island; and Shaw, in
Virginia; besides Kent, Clay, Marshall, and Randolph,
who were, many of them, not only solving
political problems, but exerting an influence in the
school systems planned for their several States.</p>

<p>Many of these were classical academy men, and
we can but see that the education received in these
schools must affect the systems they would father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in their several States. Had the colleges remained
true to their trust with Christian education, the
academies would have been preparatory schools
for Christian colleges, and men sent forth from
their walls would have been firmly grounded in the
principles of Christian education, going forth into
every State of the Union to found Christian schools
which would in their turn make earnest and
valiant youth, true to Protestantism and true to
republicanism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When the church fails to educate, men
turn to the state.</span> These men “differed in
their views about the Constitution, and wrangled
over the dangers of centralization; the best men
were fearful of the inroads of slavery and the
dangers to commerce,” says Boone, “but all
agreed that intelligence was necessary to citizenship.”
Washington said, “In proportion as the
structure of a government gives force to public
opinion, it is necessary that public opinion should
be enlightened,” and Jefferson urged that “the
diffusion of light and education are the resources
most to be relied on for ameliorating the condition,
promoting the virtue, and advancing the happiness
of man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a demand for the highest and most
practical kind of education. Statesmen see that
statesmen, <i>citizens</i>, are needed. The denominational
colleges ceased to educate Christians, and
citizens must be educated elsewhere. “In 1805
the Public School Society, of New York City, was
formed; the claims of public primary education
were urged in Boston in 1818; and New York provided
for the county supervision of schools. Early
in the nineteenth century were either introduced or
else discussed the first high schools, manual training
schools, and mechanics’ institutes, teachers’
associations, teachers’ publications, professional
schools, and free public libraries.”</p>

<p>We have entered the third period.</p>

<span class="smaller">AMERICA AND THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM (Continued)</span></h2>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">The Nineteenth Century</span></h3>

<p>The problem of elementary preparatory education
fell from the hands of the churches, and was
taken up by the state. What is the character of
that education which the state can rightfully support?
A momentous question indeed; but before
considering it, let us investigate the schools that
the state has organized, and which it did, and still
does, support. There was an urgent demand for
liberal education, and several States appropriated
lands toward a school fund. As early as 1786
“New York State set apart two lots in each
township of the unoccupied lands, for ‘gospel
and school purposes,’” and by a vote of about
eighteen hundred, devoted the proceeds of half
a million acres of vacant lands to the support of
the common schools. Other States followed the
same general plan, some in rapid succession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
others more slowly. One thing was a settled
fact,—the <i>education of the common people, passed
over by the churches, had been taken up by the
government</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horace
Mann and
the public
schools</div>

<p>Under those circumstances it is not
surprising that in 1837, Horace Mann,
president of the Massachusetts Senate,
interested himself in the subject of education.
Of this man it is said, “Rarely have
great ability, unselfish devotion, and brilliant success
been so united in the course of a single life.”
This man became the father of the public-school
system of the United States, and began a work
which long before should have been started by the
popular churches of America. But it was neglected
by them, and it will be profitable for us to watch
the development of the grandest system of schools
ever organized,—a system which, if the subject of
Christian education could be dropped, and it be
viewed alone from the standpoint of the politician,
has brought the United States into prominence as
an educational center among the nations of the
world. However, since <i>republicanism rests in the
bosom of Protestantism, and Protestantism is
cradled in Christian education</i>, the moment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
feature of Christian education is laid aside, and the
system purports to be civil (but in fact it is never
really that), that moment it loses its real vitality
and genuine strength. But to return to Mr.
Mann and his wonderful work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
churches
and public
schools</div>

<p>Boone says: “The gnarls of a century’s
growth were to be smoothed; not all
of the large number of private schools
were in accord with the new movement,
and the churches were naturally watchful of the
encroachments of unsectarian education.”<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> This
expression describes the sectarian schools as in
much the same attitude as that assumed by the
weakening Christian church about the days of Constantine;
and as the church of those days held out
its hands to a stronger power for aid, and because
it had lost its individual supply of strength,—the
Spirit of God,—so now these sectarian schools
watched with a jealous eye the progress of unsectarian
schools, and, unable to hold their former
and their allotted position by virtue of inherent
strength, they reached out their hands to the state
coffers, and received aid. Yale did it before the
days of Horace Mann; many others have done it
since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvements
made by
Horace
Mann</div>

<p>Boone continues: “Incompetent teachers
were fearful, politicians carped, and
general conservatism hindered” by the
advances of Mr. Mann. “Much was
to be accomplished, also, within the
school. Teachers had to be improved, interest
awakened, methods rationalized, and the whole
adjusted to the available resources. Moreover,
school architecture had to be studied. All this
Mr. Mann did.” How great was the opportunity
which the religious sects of America had missed!
Some of the things which were accomplished in
the next few years are thus reported: “A system
of normal schools was originated. The annual
appropriation for schools was doubled; two million
dollars expended on houses and furniture;
the number of women teachers increased; institutes
introduced and systematized; school libraries
multiplied; education provided for the dependent,
and young offending classes, and the first compulsory
school law of the State enacted.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
Bernard</div>

<p>Henry Bernard, a young lawyer of Connecticut,
did for his State a work similar
to that of Horace Mann in Massachusetts.
He was a man of keen insight, and struck at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
root of many evils. Finding that public money
was misapplied, and many primary children neglected,
he went about to work a reform. “Teachers
were awakened, associations for mutual
improvement were formed.... He established
an educational periodical,” wholly at his own expense.
In 1843 this strong-hearted, level-headed
man was called by the State of Rhode Island to
straighten out the tangles in her educational system.
From this beginning has grown the public
school system as seen to-day. It is interwoven in
the meshes of our national history from Boston to
San Francisco, and from St. Paul to New Orleans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reaction
in colleges</div>

<p>The colleges had made necessary the
academies—classical preparatory schools;
and these sent forth men who modeled
the high schools after the academic course. The
Christian colleges set the pace to begin with; then,
finding themselves outrun in the race, to meet the
needs, the nineteenth century sees a gradual but
none the less decided change in their courses of
instruction. Here are a few of the changes, with
the reasons for them. Says Boone:—</p>

<p>“The current and recent magnifying of the
humanities, the growing recognition of an altruistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and co-operative spirit in civil and social and political
life, the increasing complexity of social forces,
new aspects of government, the fundamental oneness
of all life, and sequent idea of the solidarity
of human society, have created for the student new
lines of investigation.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>How true! How wide the separation between
the ideal held before the early Harvard and that
of the Harvard of to-day. “The sequent idea of
the solidarity of human society” as a new line of
investigation for students, seems almost like mockery
when we see the fundamental principles of the
government loosening, and ready to crumble on the
application of some unexpected force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further
changes</div>

<p>The same departure from the study of
God’s Word and the record of his dealings
with men and nations—God in history
and politics—is noticeable in the curriculum
of each modern college and university. To quote
again from Boone, “The history of customs and
institutions, the growth of opinions and sentiments
as crystallized in social forms, the study of governments
and religions, of art and industry, are clamoring
for a place in the curriculum. Comparative
philology, with the enlarged interest of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
languages, belongs to the present period.” Such
a curriculum can not but have weight in molding
the minds of men, and the history we are making
to-day is but the resultant of the thoughts inculcated
in our modern colleges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution
taught</div>

<p>The chair in science has been greatly
enlarged: the ideas of evolution as advocated
by Darwin, Huxley, and Dana
have crept into the lecture courses, and having
been received, bid fair to stay. Says Boone:
“It has been said that biological study [in the
universities] began with Huxley in England, and
later in this country.” “Of the several courses
in Harvard, thirty per cent are in science, and in
most other contemporary institutions a similar
large ratio obtains. This has had its influence
upon the accepted curriculum.” This science
would be termed by the Apostle Paul “science
falsely so called.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Multiplication
of
courses</div>

<p>“Great changes have occurred in the
twenty years [since 1868] in the multiplication
of courses and the accompanying
specializations of study.”
Perhaps figures will be more impressive on this
point than mere words. Boone states that “of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the forty-seven higher institutions whose reports
are given by Dr. Adams, including Harvard,
Columbia, and Brown, and ten leading State
universities, forty-six report an aggregate of <i>one
hundred and eighty-nine</i> courses in history and
closely related studies.” Cornell now offers so
many courses that should a student attempt to
take them all, it would require more than the
natural life of a man to complete them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A cramming
system
with
children</div>

<p>It is not with any spirit of condemnation
that these things are stated,
but it can be seen by all that there
is a meaning which inevitably attaches
to these changes. The multiplicity of subjects
taught has led to a wonderful book study, and
a student’s whole life is spent in an attempt
to put into his own head the thoughts which
others have written for him. The spirit of the
universities was caught by the academies, and by
the high schools, and is reflected even in the
lower grades. It is the beginning of the cramming
process now so forcibly denounced by a
few true educators. Readers of our magazines
are familiar with the ideas expressed by Mrs.
Lew Wallace in “The Murder of the Modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Innocents,” by the editor of the <i>Ladies’ Home
Journal</i>, and others. I deem it sufficient to
quote from Mr. Edward Bok, who startled
American homes by stating that “in five cities
of our country alone there were, during the
last school term, over sixteen thousand children
between the ages of eight and fourteen
taken out of the public schools because their
nervous systems were wrecked, and their minds
were incapable of going on any farther in the
infernal cramming system which exists to-day in
our schools.... It was planned by nature
that between the years of seven and fifteen
the child should have rest,—not rest which
will stop all mental and physical growth, of
course, ... but the child’s pace should be
checked so as to allow him to recover from
the strain which his system has just undergone.</p>

<p>“But what really happens to the child at the
age of seven? Is he given this period of rest?—Verily,
no! He enters the schoolroom, and becomes
a victim of long hours of confinement—the
first mental application, mind you, that the child
has ever known. The nervous wear and tear
begins; the child is fairly launched upon his enjoyment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
(God save the mark!) of the great educational
system of America.... Special systems of
‘marks,’ which amount to prizes, are started, serving
only to stimulate the preternaturally bright
child, who needs relaxation most of all, and to
discourage the child who happens to be below the
average of intelligence. It is cramming, cramming,
cramming! A certain amount of ‘ground
must be gone over,’ as it is usually called.
Whether the child is physically able to work the
ground, does not enter into the question. And we
do not stop even there! The poor children are
compelled to carry home a pile of books to study,
usually after supper, and just before going to bed,
and that is about the most barbarous part of the
whole system.”<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>This is enough to show that the system is recognized
as practicing methods not in accordance
with the laws of nature, which are the laws of
God. Such methods are the result of the system
at the head of which stand the colleges and universities
which outline the work for all below
them.</p>

<p>Parents read these statements with wonder and
a feeling of horror, but only a few realize that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
primary schools and the grammar schools, and
even the high schools, are responsible for the
health-destroying, brain-benumbing methods employed
in our public schools. The cause for the
present system and methods is to be searched for
in the changes which time has wrought in those
simple schools planted by the freedom-seeking
Puritan fathers. Say, rather, that Protestantism
offered a system of Christian education which, if
it had been followed, would have prevented what
we find to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern
reformers</div>

<p>It is gratifying to find that the decline
has not proceeded undisturbed. Its history
has not sped on as a smooth-flowing
river. From time to time men have arisen
offering educational ideas in advance of the age in
which they taught. Such men were Comenius
and Pestalozzi, who introduced object-study in
place of the time-honored memory work; and
Froebel, whose patient labors for the children of
the kindergarten have not only endeared him to
the heart of the true teacher, but have made him a
benefactor of mankind in that he aroused queries
in regard to the methods of instructing the human
mind. These men, searching for truth, caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
glimpses of the principles of true education as
taught by Christ. Disciples of these men, instead
of taking from them a borrowed light, have the
privilege of going again to the source of true wisdom,—“the
Teacher come from God.” Here is
the secret of success for educational reformers of
the twentieth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
modern
education</div>

<p>The tide has kept up a constant ebb
and flow. When the tendency was
growing strong toward the classics,
natural science revived, and the spirit of
investigation broke the band which memory work
was weaving. Science, not content with lawful
fields of exploration, is now delving into metaphysics,
and sending to the world a race of skeptics
and infidels; or, if professed Christians, students
are confirmed evolutionists, casting aside the Word
of God for the theories of geology, astronomy,
or biology. The narrow cramming system of
memory-teaching was killing the intellectual life
of the children, when nature-study was introduced.
This was an improvement indeed, for these studies
are thought-producing; but here the tide set in
the opposite direction, and faith in a Creator is
destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As of Jerusalem, so now of the churches,
they are destroyed because the education of
the children is neglected.</span> Wherein lies the
safety of the Christian parent and his child?
The child has a right to a Christian education.
Where is it to be obtained? Can the state give
it?—It could not if it would. Are the Protestant
churches educating their own children? Few
indeed are the Christian schools, and to-day the
churches are reaping the result of their long period
of retrogression. The words of Dr. James M.
Buckley, editor of the <i>Christian Advocate</i>, the
leading organ of Methodism, voice the general
sentiment. He says in part:—</p>

<p>“That the Methodist Episcopal Church, with
nearly three million of communicants and a vast
army of Sunday-school scholars, should add less
than seven thousand to its membership in 1899, is
startling. That in the same period it should show
a decline of 28,595 in those avowed and accepted
candidates known as probationers, is ominous.
Such a situation has not been frequent in our
history.... No reverent person can charge the
decline to God the Father Almighty, to Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, or to the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Ghost, in whom the church ceaselessly declares
its belief. It must therefore lie at the doors of
every church.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>This statement is very true; and yet, while
exonerating God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit from
any blame in the matter, it is sad to note that
prominent men in the ministry fail to see that the
churches are losing their hold upon humanity
because they have relinquished their right as
Protestants to educate the children. The churches
are to be pitied; but there is only one remedy,
and that church which takes up its neglected
duty in <i>education</i> will receive the reward. To the
students of prophecy it is a significant fact that
this state of affairs has been growing deplorably
worse since about the year 1843 or 1844.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of
elective
system</div>

<p>The fluctuations which have occurred in
the curricula of our leading schools has
been referred to before, but is emphasized
by a glance at the introduction of
the elective courses. When the course of instruction
became decidedly complex, requiring years
for completion, and the multiplication of subjects
made it impracticable for the majority of students
to complete the course as outlined, there arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the privilege of option in the choice of the studies
in many courses. This was also made necessary
in the colleges by the organization of many technical
schools throughout the land. “The early
efforts to establish mechanics and manual-labor
institutes are interesting as marking a reaction
against the dominance of language and metaphysics,
and an ingenious appeal for the large recognition
of the physical sciences.” This has led in
some cases to the substitution of German or some
other modern language, and an increased amount
of mathematics in place of the classics, the students
being free to choose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom
of Virginia
University</div>

<p>This spirit of freedom, which has been
almost wrenched, one might say, from
many of the institutions of higher learning,
is occasionally found to have swayed
the hearts of earlier educators. One reads with
keen relish the history of the founding of the
University of Virginia, the moving spirit of which
was Thomas Jefferson. The reader will be interested
in a paragraph by Boone:—</p>

<p>“As early as 1779, while the ‘Old Dominion,’
with her sister States, was embroiled in a doubtful
war; and again in 1814, after numerous defeats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and constant opposition from the already-established
William and Mary College, from the Protestant
churches, and from most of the political
leaders of the time, Mr. Jefferson and his friends
sought to provide for the state, along with the
general system of education, a university, in which
should be taught in the highest degree, ‘every
branch of knowledge, whether calculated to enrich,
stimulate, and adorn the understanding, or to
be useful in the arts and practical business of life.’
Five years later (1819) an act of the Assembly
was obtained establishing the University of Virginia.
When six years later it was opened, after
a wide acquaintance and careful study of the
most progressive institutions in the United States,
it was found that in discipline and instruction,
in constitution and means, it very materially differed
from them all.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom
from other
objectionable
features</div>

<p>The far-reaching sight of the chief promoter
of the enterprise is seen when we
note wherein lay this very material difference.
“There is one practice,” wrote
Mr. Jefferson, “from which we shall certainly
vary, although it has been copied by nearly
every college and academy in the United States;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
that is, the holding of the students all to one prescribed
course of reading, and disallowing exclusive
application to those branches only which are
to qualify them for the particular vocation to which
they are destined. We shall, on the contrary,
allow them uncontrolled choice in the lectures they
shall choose to attend, and <i>require elementary</i>
qualifications only, and sufficient age.”<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>This was a wonderful step for the time in which
it occurred, and indicates the direction given to
minds of men by the Spirit of God. The greater
freedom occasioned by the adoption of the elective
system is felt throughout the educational centers of
our land. Johns Hopkins University grants the
degree of B.A. in four out of six of its courses
without the classics. This leads us, however, to
a consideration of the question suggested several
pages back, <i>What subjects can of right be taught
in schools supported from the public funds?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Should the
state support
the
school</div>

<p>Education, pure and simple, in the
breadth of its meaning, is character development.
The state, as such, can not
judge of motives, hence it can not educate
the inner man. The two phases of the
Reformation were Protestantism and republicanism;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the first deals with the spiritual nature, and
through this reaches the entire man, making a
symmetrical character; the governmental part
deals only with the mental and physical—the outward
manifestations. To the church was committed
the charge of the spiritual man, and the commission
to “teach all nations” given to the little
company that watched the ascending Lord, was
repeated to the church in the sixteenth century;
and with especial weight was this burden laid upon
the shoulders of American men and women. The
state needs men to carry forward its pursuits; and
for the purely secular training of such individuals,
it has a perfect right, even a duty, to provide from
the common fund. A purely mechanical, secular,
or business course might therefore be offered in
our state schools; but with such an education few
parents are contented. The moral nature needs
training; in order to be good citizens, it is argued,
some part of the system of ethics which is based
on the doctrines of Christ must be inculcated.
Christian schools, and those only, can give a spiritual
education. This is the dilemma in which the
educational system found itself about the time of
the Revolution, and the matter, instead of reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a satisfactory solution, has grown steadily
worse. The churches failed to provide for the
Christian training; and the state felt that something
must be done for the children. Public
schools were established; but these, by right, can
not teach morality or anything pertaining thereto.
But they do. Hence, the church by her failure has
forced the state into the attempt to do her work,—an
impossible task. Again, the churches and
the denominational schools, not willing to be outdone
by state institutions, have extended their
stakes and lengthened their cords until they offer,
not those subjects which are character building, so
much as those which will enable them to compete
with state institutions. Here again is a departure
from Christian education, and a mixture which
would be hard to designate as other than papal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degrees
a papal
mark</div>

<p>Again, the state sets its seal upon work
done in institutions which it supports,
and the Christian schools—those in
name at least—not only accept public
money, but allow the state to put its seal to their
work in the granting of literary degrees and
diplomas. This is a natural result of the union
of worldly education and the principles of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
education which we have followed through
two centuries, and yet to-day there is scarcely a
school claiming to be Christian in its principles
that dare raise its voice against the customs of
its sister institutions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
and state
unite;
result,
papal</div>

<p>“Render, therefore, unto Cæsar the
things that be Cæsar’s, and unto God
the things which be God’s,” would be
repeated, should the author of those
words enter in person the institutions
of learning which claim to bear his name. A
union of church and state is described as the
papacy; a union of education (the foundation of
the church) and the state is passed by with
scarcely a dissenting voice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Educational
work of
Catholics</div>

<p>So far in this chapter, the educational
work of the Catholic Church in the
United States has been passed without
a word;—not because that organization
has been less active here than in European countries,
but because the idea is so prevalent that a
system of education to be papal must emanate
from the Roman Church. Ideas to the contrary
have been emphasized again and again in these
pages. In our own country we can not fail to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
that, aside from the work of the Catholic Church,
there has been developed a papal system of
instruction. The stepping-stones from the present
back into the dim ages of the past, when
Egypt or Greece swayed the world through
science or philosophy, may in places be hidden;
but the products of Greek philosophy and Egyptian
wisdom, seasoned with the ideas of the medieval
scholasticism, or the more subtle mixture of
modern Christian education and the papal system
as exemplified by Sturm, to which is attached the
State’s seal of approval, meet us from season to
season as our schools send forth their graduates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catholic
schools</div>

<p>The Catholics, however, have not
watched the growth of our educational
system without putting forth a vigorous
effort. From Colonial days, when the Jesuits
flocked to these shores, and taught the established
schools and missions, to the present time, when
the new university for the education of Catholic
youth is in full operation at our national capital,
this organization has spared no effort. As Boone
says, “All other denominational service in education
is partial and irregular compared with the
comprehensive grasp of the Catholic Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Their aim is all-inclusive, and assumes no other
agency. Ignoring the public school, their plan is
co-extensive with their membership. With one
fifth of all the theological seminaries, and one
third of all their students; with one fourth of the
colleges, nearly six hundred academies, and two
thousand six hundred parochial schools (elementary),
instructing more than half a million children,
the church is seen to be a force which,
educationally considered, is equaled by no other
single agency but the government itself.”<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The system by which this work is carried forward
is thus described: “The twelve Catholic
provinces ... are subdivided into seventy-nine
dioceses. The latter average from thirty-five to
forty parishes, each of which is supposed to have
a school for the elementary training of their children.
As a matter of fact, <i>ninety-three per cent</i>
of them maintain parochial schools, in which are
educated, generally by the priesthood, ... the
511,063 pupils. In addition to these are five
hundred and eighty-eight academies, usually for
the girls, and ninety-one colleges.” This was
written six or seven years ago, but the figures
speak for themselves. With the nation honeycombed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
by schools which have as their avowed
object the annihilation of Protestantism and republicanism;
with our own public-school system,
so grand in many respects, <i>yet compromising
until it is indeed papal</i>, it is not strange that
Methodist and Presbyterian congregations are bemoaning
their dwindling numbers.</p>

<p>Should Protestants educate their own children?
History speaks in emphatic language, Yes! The
papacy says, If you wish us to have your children,
No!</p>

<span class="smaller">CHRISTIAN EDUCATION</span></h2>

<p>After watching the educational struggle which
has gone on for ages between truth and error, and
observing that scarcely a century has passed which
has not witnessed a controversy more or less severe
between Christian and papal methods of instruction,
one is prepared to believe that this is a subject
inseparably connected with the history of
nations. This being true, we must expect to find
ourselves in the midst of the controversy to-day.
It needs but a casual glance at current history to
confirm this fact; for minds are troubled because of
existing evils, and hearts are open for educational
truth.</p>

<p>If we are inclined to think that the principles of
Christian education are new and before unheard of,
we have but to catch the thoughts which have
swayed true educators from the time of Christ
to the present day to know that the same spirit
has been at work in all ages to draw the hearts of
men to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
education
exemplified
by Christ</div>

<p>The advent of Christ was a wonderful
event. “The Word was made flesh, and
dwelt among us.” That man might behold
the workings of God in human
flesh, and see here the manifestation of truth,
Christ was born. His was pre-eminently a work
of education, and His system was <i>Christian education</i>.
By this means, Heaven again reached earth,
and clasped it to her bosom. Men, in their shortsightedness,
were unable to comprehend the spiritual
teachings of the Son of God, and often His
most powerful lessons fell unappreciated on the
ears of the multitudes, and even on the ears of
the apostles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Holy
Spirit the
teacher</div>

<p>Much as the life of Christ has done for
the world, there has never been a man,
or a nation of men, who have fully followed
his teachings. Error has ever
been mixed with truth, and the educators of the
world have failed to see the realization of their
hopes because of this partial grasp of truth.</p>

<p>Christ, when rejected by the world, did not
withdraw entirely, and leave man to his fate; but
He sent forth His Spirit, the <i>Spirit of Truth</i> as
an educator, leading minds into truth. This working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of the Spirit is plainly seen, for one man has
been directed to one phase of true education,
while another, perhaps a contemporary worker, or
perhaps a successor, it may be a fellow countryman,
or one at a great distance, has picked up
another thread in the skein, and developed another
thought for the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True education
always
represented</div>

<p>The world has never long been left without
some representative of Christian education.
In attempting to define the term
which stands as the subject of this chapter,
attention is called to the partial work
of reform which has been accomplished by men
whom the world recognizes as educators. The
errors of a false education, so prevalent in times
past, and still recognized as a part of the educational
systems now in vogue, stand in strong contrast
to the correct ideas advocated by these men
at various times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Latin and
word-study
in
papal
schools</div>

<p>The men whose ideas are given in this
chapter lived and wrought after the
Reformation; and in order to reveal the
error against which they worked, it is
necessary to consider the methods of
instruction to be found in papal schools. Similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
thoughts are found on previous pages, but, for the
sake of contrast, they are here repeated.</p>

<p>Painter says: “When a young man had acquired a
thorough mastery of the Latin language for all purposes;
when he was well versed in the theological
and philosophical opinions of his preceptors; when
he was skillful in dispute, and could make a brilliant
display from the resources of a well-stored
memory, he had reached the highest points to
which the Jesuits sought to lead him. <i>Originality
and independence</i> of mind, <i>love of truth for its
own sake, the power of reflecting, and of forming
correct judgments, were not merely neglected</i>, they
were suppressed in the Jesuits’ system.”<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Karl
Schmidt likewise testifies in the words, “<i>Books</i>,
<i>words</i>, had been the subjects of instruction....
<i>The knowledge of things was wanting.</i> Instead
of things themselves, <i>words about the things were
taught</i>.” “Learning by doing” is the rule in
Christian education. A large amount of Latin
and Greek was, and is still, the rule in the
papal educational system, and these languages
were taught, not for the sake of thought, but
merely for the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reformers
oppose
mere
language
study</div>

<p>The world had for a century been bound
by the study of the classics. This bondage
was broken by the Reformation, but
the world returned thither again. Milton,
the poet of the seventeenth century,
wrote: “Language is but the <i>instrument</i> conveying
to us things useful to be known. Though a
linguist should pride himself to have all the tongues
that Babel cleft the world into, yet if he have not
studied the solid things in them, as well as the
words and lexicons, he were nothing so much to be
esteemed a learned man as any yeoman or tradesman
competently wise in his mother dialect only....
We do amiss to spend seven or eight years
in scraping together so much Latin and Greek as
might be learned otherwise easily and delightfully
in one year.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Things
studied
instead of
language</div>

<p>Ratich, a German educator of the sixteenth
century, said: “We are in bondage
to Latin. The Greeks and Saracens
would never have done so much for posterity
if they had spent their youth in acquiring a
foreign tongue. We must study our own language,
and then the sciences.” “Everything first in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
mother tongue,” and “nothing on mere authority,”
were rules in his schoolroom. Comenius, the
renowned teacher, used to say: “If so much time
is to be spent on the language alone, when is the
boy to know about things,—when will he learn
philosophy, when religion, and so forth? He will
consume his life in preparing for life.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mechanical
teaching
is
papal</div>

<p>How exactly this applies to the word-study
of our boys and girls to-day! It
matters not whether it be Latin or English
grammar; indeed, it may be that
other mode of expression,—some form of mathematics,—where
time and energy are devoted to
the process merely. A failure to make the development
of thought—independent thinking, in
fact—the main object in instruction, stamps any
method of teaching as papal, no matter by what
name it is known, or by whom the subjects are
taught. It was the life work of Comenius to counteract
this tendency, as the following principles
show. He insisted that “nothing should be taught
that is not of solid utility.” “Nothing is to be
learned by heart that is not first thoroughly
understood.” “Theologians and physicians should
study Greek.” “Doing can be learned only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
doing.” That educational reformers of to-day are
advocating these same principles will be seen later.
This is a part of Christian education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character-building
the aim
in true
education</div>

<p>John Locke, an English educator of the
seventeenth century, had truth on the
subject of education. Of the languages,
he says: “When I consider what ado is
made about a little Latin and Greek,
how many years are spent in it, and what a noise
and business it makes to no purpose, I can hardly
forbear thinking that parents of children still live
in fear of the schoolmaster’s rod, which they look
on as the only instrument of education; as if a
language or two were its whole business.”</p>

<p>Character was valued by this man, and his statement
as to the relative importance of study is
valuable to parents and teachers. “Reading
and writing and learning I allow to be necessary,
but yet not the chief business. I imagine you think
him a very foolish fellow that should not value a
virtuous or a wise man infinitely before a scholar.
Not but that I think learning a great help to both,
in well-disposed minds; but yet it must be confessed
also that in others not so disposed, it helps
them only to be the more foolish or worse men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">How Locke
would
choose a
teacher</div>

<p>“I say this, that when you consider
the breeding of your son, and are looking
out for a schoolmaster, or a tutor, you
would not have, as is usual, Latin and
logic only in your thoughts. Learning must be
had, but in the second place, as subservient only to
greater qualities. Seek out somebody that may
know how discreetly to frame his manners: place
him in hands where you may, as much as possible,
secure his innocence, cherish and nurse up the
good, and gently correct and weed out any bad
inclinations, and settle in him good habits. <span class="smcap">This
is the main point</span>; and this being provided for,
learning may be had into the bargain.”</p>

<p>To how great an extent are Protestants following
this excellent advice? In what schools for Protestant
boys and girls is innocence cherished? where
is the good nourished? where are bad inclinations
gently weeded out, and good habits settled? where
do these things take a position ahead of book
learning?</p>

<p>“Virtue,” continues Locke, “as the first and
most necessary of those endowments that belong
to a man or gentleman, was based on religion. As
the foundation of this, there ought very early to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
imprinted on his mind a true notion of God.”
Here one finds a clear conception of Christian
education, which parents of to-day would do well
to study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cramming
a papal
method</div>

<p>The study of the classics, together with
the memory work which was the chief
characteristic of these studies, was not
the only defect in papal education; hence
it is not the only error from which educators, led,
as one must believe, by the spirit of truth, have
from time to time broken away. The cramming
system, so justly denounced by thinking minds as
one of the most far-reaching defects of the present
school system, is a mark of papal education wherever
it may be found. And probably no generation
has passed which has not heard some voice lifted
against this pernicious practice of the schoolroom.
The God of heaven recognizes that the human
mind contains the highest possibilities of earth;
the child is a part of himself; and when wrong
methods of education are used in dealing with
developing minds, He, the head of the body, of
which we are members, feels the hurt; so it is
that Christian education is an emanation from
the mind of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Montaigne, speaking of education in the sixteenth
century, said: “It is the custom of schoolmasters
to be eternally thundering in their pupils’
ears, as if they were pouring into a funnel, while
the pupils’ business is only to repeat what their
masters have said.” He is taught that “a tutor
... should, according to the capacity he has to
deal with, put it [the child’s mind] to the test, permitting
his pupil himself to taste and relish things,
and of himself to choose and discern them....
Too much learning stifles the soul, just as plants
are stifled by too much moisture, and lamps by too
much oil. Our pedants plunder knowledge from
books, and carry it on the tips of their lips, just as
birds carry seeds to feed their young.... We
toil and labor only to <i>stuff the memory</i>, but leave
the <i>conscience and understanding unfurnished and
void</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Twentieth
century
schools
cram</div>

<p>As late as January, 1900, Edward Bok,
editor of the <i>Ladies’ Home Journal</i>,
wrote concerning the cramming process
of the popular schools: “Do American
men and women realize that in five cities of our
country alone there were, during the last school
term, <i>over sixteen thousand children</i> between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
ages of eight and fourteen taken out of the public
schools because their nervous systems were
wrecked, and their minds were incapable of going
on any further in the infernal cramming system
which exists to-day in our schools?... Conservative
medical men who have given their lives to the
study of children place the number whose health is
shattered by overstudy at more than 50,000 each
year.... It is cramming, cramming, cramming.
A certain amount of ‘ground must be gone over,’ as
it is usually called. Whether the child is physically
able to work the ‘ground’ does not enter into the
question.”</p>

<p>The writer dwells upon the evils of night study,
and continues: “True reform always begins at
the root of all evils, and the root of the evil
of home study lies in the cramming system.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mrs. Lew
Wallace
on cramming</div>

<p>Mrs. Lew Wallace says: “Go into any
public school, and you will see girls
pallid as day lilies and boys with flat
chests and the waxen skin that has been
named the school complexion. Every incentive
and stimulus is held out; dread of blame, love
of praise, prizes, medals, badges, the coveted
flourish in the newspapers—the strain never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
slackens.... The burden is <i>books</i>. The tasks
imposed on the young are fearful. The effort
seems to be to make text-books as difficult and
complicated as possible instead of smoothing the
hill so high and hard to climb.”</p>

<p>In her characteristic style, Mrs. Wallace condemns
the usual methods of teaching arithmetic
and language:—</p>

<p>“Said a mother, ‘Two and two are what?’”</p>

<p>“The boy hesitated.</p>

<p>“‘Surely you know that two and two make
four.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, mama; but I am trying to remember
the process.’</p>

<p>“Process, indeed!...</p>

<p>“One day Mary was bending over a tablet
writing words on both sides of a straight line,
like multiplied numerators and denominators.</p>

<p>“‘What are you at now?’ asked grandma.</p>

<p>“Mary answered with pride, ‘I am diagraming.’</p>

<p>“‘In the name of sense, what’s diagraming?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s mental discipline. Miss Cram says I
have a fine mind that needs developing. Look

elements. <i>Fourscore</i> and <i>seven</i> are joined by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
word <i>and</i>, a subordinate connective copulative
conjunction. It modifies <i>years</i>, the attribute of
the preposition. <i>Ago</i> is a modal verb of past
time. The root of the first clause is—.</p>

<p>“‘Why, that’s Lincoln’s speech at Gettysburg.
I keep it in my work-basket and know it by heart.’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed! Well, <i>ours</i> is a simple personal—.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s enough. If President Lincoln had
been brought up on such stuff, that speech
would never have been written. He called a
noun a noun, and was done with it.’”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Montaigne could scarcely have given a more
vivid description had he seen the grind of modern
education, where grades are strictly kept, and
all children, the strong and the tender alike, are
forced through the same process. There is no
relief save in dropping by the wayside when
disease fastens its tendrils on the human frame.</p>

<p>Against this system all educational reformers
have striven, but it remains with us still. Christian
parents, could they see the relative value
of soul and mental culture, would demand the
establishment of a new order of things. Christian
education alone can effect a cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature-study
to
prevent
cramming</div>

<p>Comenius strove to correct this error
by the introduction of nature-study.
He says: “The right instruction of
youth does not consist in cramming
them with a mass of words, phrases, sentences,
and opinions collected from authors, but in unfolding
the understanding, that many little streams
may flow therefrom as from a living fountain....
Why shall we not, instead of dead books,
open the living book of nature? Not the shadows
of things, but the things themselves, which
make an impression on the senses and the
imagination, are to be brought before youth.
By actual observation, not by a verbal description
of things, must instruction begin....
Men must be led as far as possible to draw
their wisdom, not from books, but from a consideration
of heaven and earth, oaks and beeches;
that is, they must know and examine things
themselves, and not simply be contented with the
observations and testimony of others.”</p>

<p>His fundamental principles were, “Education is
a development of the whole man,” and “Many
studies are to be avoided as dissipating the mental
strength.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern
science
study and
doubt</div>

<p>A long stride was taken by Comenius
toward breaking the mechanical teaching
of the papacy. The error into which
his followers fall is in making nature
the all in all, failing to recognize the Word of
God as the only guide and interpreter of natural
phenomena. This mistake has led modern schools
to take the position in science studies which is
described in the following words by Frank S. Hoffman,
professor of philosophy in one of America’s
leading theological schools: “Every man, because
he is a man, is endowed with powers for
forming judgments, and he is placed in this world
to develop and apply those powers to all the
objects with which he comes in contact.”<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In
such words does he plainly state that human reason
is the means by which man is to obtain his wisdom.
Then follows his explanation of the method
of procedure when reason has been thus exalted.
These are his words: “In every sphere of investigation
he [man] should <i>begin with doubt</i>, and
the student will make the most rapid progress <i>who
has acquired <span class="smcap">the art of doubting well</span></i>.”</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that the subject under consideration
is some newly discovered natural phenomenon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
and the student of nature wishes to
investigate. According to Professor Hoffman, a
modern theologian, and hence a teacher, he must
“begin with doubt, and the student will make the
most rapid progress who has acquired the art of
doubting well.” Christian education, in contrast
with this method, says, “Through faith we
understand.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Methods in
Sciences
and
theology</div>

<p>That this method of study—to begin
with doubt—is not only applicable to
the natural sciences, but to the study
of spiritual truths also, Professor Hoffman
continues: “We ask that every student of
theology take up the subject precisely as he would
any other science: <i>that he begin with doubt</i>, and
carefully weigh the arguments for every doctrine,
accepting or rejecting each assertion according as
the balance of probabilities is for or against it....
We believe that even the teachings of Jesus
should be viewed from this standpoint, and should
be accepted or rejected on the ground of their
inherent reasonableness.”</p>

<p>Thus the spirit of doubt with which the child
is taught to study nature, goes with him through
all his school years; it grows with his growth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and if he enters a theological school to prepare
for the ministry, he is confronted by the same
method in the investigation of the teachings of
Christ. What wonder that the results of modern
education are a class of infidels and skeptics?</p>

<p>The words of President Harper, of Chicago
University, are worth repeating: “It is difficult
to prophesy what the results of our present
method of educating the youth will be in fifty
years. We are training the mind in the public
schools, but the moral side in the child’s nature is
almost entirely neglected.” Not only is it neglected,
but faith is trampled to the ground, and human
reason exalted above its prostrate form. “<i>When
the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the
earth?</i>” A pertinent question, indeed, for educators
to answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
method of
“doubt”
is Socratic</div>

<p>This method of doubting is papal, and
can be traced directly to Socrates, the
Greek. Of him, we read: “Socrates
was not a ‘philosopher,’ nor yet a
‘teacher,’ but rather an ‘educator,’ having for his
function ‘to rouse, persuade, and rebuke’....
<i>Socrates’ theory of education had for its basis a
<span class="smcap">profound and consistent conception</span>.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>In dealing with his students, the same authority
thus states his method of procedure: “Taking his
departure from some apparently remote principle
or proposition to which the respondent yielded a
ready assent, Socrates would draw from it an
unexpected but undeniable consequence which was
plainly inconsistent with the opinion impugned.
In this way he brought his interlocutor to pass
judgment upon himself, and reduced him to a state
<i>of doubt</i> or perplexity. ‘Before I ever met you,’
says Meno, in a dialogue which Plato called by his
name, ‘I was told <i>that you spent your time in
doubting and leading others to doubt:</i> and it is
a fact that your witcheries and spells have brought
me to that condition; you are like the torpedo;
as it benumbs anyone who approaches and touches
it, so do you.’”</p>

<p>We can readily trace the connection between
the Socratic method of doubting and the same
method as advocated by the professor of the
theological school, for “his [Socrates’s] practice
led to the Platonic revival,” and the Platonic
system of education and its introduction in modern
schools has been too thoroughly discussed in previous
pages to need repetition here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“Doubt”
taught in
modern
schools</div>

<p>The Socratic method of teaching—the
development of doubt—seems to characterize
much of the teaching of to-day,
if we can judge from an article which
appeared in the <i>Outlook</i>, written by the editor,
Lyman Abbott. The educational work is thus
described:—</p>

<p>“The educational processes of our time—possibly
of all time—are largely analytical and
critical. They consist chiefly in analyzing the
subjects brought to the student for examination,
separating them into their constituent parts, considering
how they have been put together, and
sitting in judgment on the finished fabric or on
the process by which it has been constructed.</p>

<p>“Thus all, or nearly all, study is analytical,
critical,—a process of inquiry and investigation.
The process presupposes an inquiring if not a
skeptical mood. <i>Doubt</i> is the pedagogue which
leads the pupil to <i>knowledge</i>.</p>

<p>“Does he study the human body?—Dissection
and anatomy are the foundations of his study.
Chemistry?—The laboratory furnishes him the
means of analysis and inquiry into physical substances.
History?—He questions the statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
which have been unquestioned heretofore, ransacks
libraries for authorities in ancient volumes
and more ancient documents. Literature?—The
poem which he read only to enjoy he now subjects
to the scalpel, inquires whether it really is
beautiful, why it is beautiful, how its meter should
be classified, how its figures have been constructed.
Philosophy?—He subjects his own consciousness
to a process of vivisection in an endeavor to ascertain
the physiology and anatomy of the human
spirit; brings his soul into the laboratory that he
may learn its chemical constituents.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the constructive and synthetic process
is relegated to a second place, or lost sight
of altogether. Does he study medicine?—He
gives more attention to diagnosis than to therapeutics;
to the analysis of disease than to the
problem how to overcome it. Law?—He spends
more time in analyzing cases than in developing
power to grasp great principles and apply them
in the administration of justice to varying conditions.
The classics?—It is strange if he has not
at graduation spent more weeks in the syntax
and grammar of the language than he has spent
hours in acquiring and appreciating the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
and the spirit of the great classic authors. It
has been well and truly said of the modern student
that he does not study grammar to understand
Homer, he reads Homer to get the Greek
grammar. His historical study has given him
dates, events, a mental historical chart; perhaps,
too, it has given him a scholar’s power to discriminate
between the true and the false, the
historical and the mythical in ancient legends:
but not to many has it given an understanding
of the significance of events, a comprehension of,
or even new light upon, the real meaning of the
life of man on the earth. Has he been studying
philosophy?—Happy he is if, as a result of his
analysis of self-consciousness, he has not become
morbid respecting his own inner life, or cynically
skeptical concerning the inner life of others.</p>

<p>“It is doubtless in the realm of ethics and
religion that the disastrous results of a too exclusive
analytical process and a too exclusive critical
spirit are seen. Carrying the same spirit,
applying the same methods, to the investigation
of religion, the Bible becomes to him simply a
collection of ancient literature, whose sources,
structure, and forms he studies, whose spirit, he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
at least for the time, forgets; worship is a ritual
whose origin, rise, and development he investigates;
whose <i>real significance</i> as an expression
of penitence, gratitude, and consecration he loses
sight of altogether. <i>Faith</i> is a series of tenets
whose biological development he traces; or a
form of consciousness whose relation to brain
action he inquires into; or whose growth by evolutionary
processes out of earlier states he endeavors

<p>“Vivisection is almost sure sooner or later to
become a post-mortem; and the subject of it,
whether it be a flower, a body, an author, or an
experience, generally dies under the scalpel. It
is for this reason that so many students in school,
academy, and college lose not merely their theology,
which is perhaps no great loss, but their
religion, which is an irreparable loss, while they
are acquiring an education.”<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ministers

Socratic

<p>This spirit of doubt characterizes the
teachings of modern higher critics. The
critical study of the Bible, Dr. Newton
tells us, “has disposed forever of the
claim that it is such an oracle of God as we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
submit our intellects to unquestioningly.” “Dr.
Briggs says that there are three co-ordinate
authorities—the church, the Bible, and reason.
‘But when they disagree, which is to be the final
court of appeal?’ asks Dr. Newton. ‘They do
disagree widely to-day.’ Dr. Newton believes
that the ultimate court of appeal is reason,—not
the reason of Thomas Paine and the present-day
realistic rationalists, but rather the ‘<i>Divine Reason</i>’
<i>of Socrates and of Plato</i>.... Reason in this
sense means not merely or chiefly the rationalizing
faculty, but the moral nature—the whole spiritual
being of man. ‘It is what conscience teaches, as
well as what intellect affirms, that, together with
the voice of the heart, forms the trinity of true
authority—of reason.’”<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Secular
methods
and religious
truths</div>

<p>This is indeed the exaltation of reason. There
is, in such a system, no room whatever for faith.
W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner
of Education, writing of Sunday-schools,
attributes their decline to the
adoption, by Sunday-school teachers, of
the methods employed in the secular
schools. A few words from him will suffice. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
says: “With the spectacle of the systematic organization
of the secular schools and the improvement
of methods of teaching before them, the leaders in
the church have endeavored to perfect the methods
of the religious instruction of youth. They have
met the following dangers which lay in their path;
namely, first, the danger of adopting methods of instruction
in religion which were fit and proper only
for secular instruction; second, the selection of religious
matter for the course of study which did not
lead in a most direct manner toward vital religion,
although it would readily take on a pedagogic
form.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>In order to show the reason why methods which
are perfectly proper in giving secular education
are not adapted to religious instruction, Mr. Harris
explains: “The secular school gives positive
instruction. It teaches mathematics, natural science,
history, and language. Knowledge of the
facts can be precise and accurate, and a similar
knowledge of the principles can be arrived at.
The self-activity of the pupil is ... demanded
by the teacher of the secular school. The pupil
must not take things on authority, but must test
and verify.... He must trace out the mathematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
demonstrations.... He must learn the
method of investigating facts.... The spirit of
the secular school therefore comes to be an enlightening
one, although not of the highest order.”</p>

<p>The whole tendency of secular education, according
to Mr. Harris, is to develop a spirit of
investigation and proof. This, he says, is a means
of enlightening, but not of the highest order. The
highest means of enlightening the mind is by faith.
That is God’s method. Christian schools must
avoid the secular methods of instruction, adopting
in their stead that highest form of enlightening,—faith.
That separates Christian schools from secular
schools in methods as well as in the subject
matter taught.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Secular
methods
require
material
proof</div>

<p>This secular method of investigation
saps the spiritual life, and is responsible
for the decline in modern Protestantism.
Mr. Harris continues: “Religious education,
it is obvious in giving the highest
results of thought and life to the young, must cling
to the form of authority, and not attempt to borrow
the methods of mathematics, science, and
history from the secular school. Such borrowing
will result only in giving the young people an overweening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
confidence in the finality of their own
immature judgments. They will become conceited
and shallow-minded.... Against this danger of
sapping or undermining all authority in religion by
the introduction of the methods of the secular
school which lay stress on the self-activity of the
child, the Sunday-school has not been sufficiently
protected in the more recent years of its history.”</p>

<p>If the adoption of secular methods of teaching in
the Sunday-school, where children are instructed
one day only in the week, has so weakened Protestantism,
what must be the result when children
are daily taught in the public schools by methods
which tend always to exalt human reason above
faith. It is little wonder that five days’ instruction
can not be counteracted by the very best
Sabbath instruction even in those schools which
have not adopted secular methods in teaching
the Bible.</p>

<p>Protestants should learn from this that in starting
Christian schools the methods followed in the
secular schools can not be adopted. Here is the
stumbling-block over which many are apt to fall.
Religious instruction demands methods of teaching
which will develop faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion in
schools of
Comenius</div>

<p>I can not refrain from recurring to the
teachings of Comenius, since they so
strongly opposed the methods of education
followed by those who, to-day, claim
to be his disciples. James H. Blodgett says:
“Comenius, anticipating more modern leaders
in the philosophy and the art of education, prepared
an outline of the Pansophic School about
1650, in which the work of a complete education
was divided for seven classes. The general school
was to spend the first hour of the morning in
hymns, Bible reading, and prayers.”<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> “Class
III, the Atrial,” we are told by the same writer,
“was to have the inscription, ‘Let no one enter who
can not speak.’ In this class the boys should
begin to read the Bible.... The history of this
class is the famous deeds of the Biblical narrative.”
Of Class IV we read: “A special collection of
hymns and psalms must be arranged for this class;
also an epitome of the New Testament, which
should comprise a continuous life of Christ and His
apostles, compiled from the four Gospels....
The accessory study is Greek.... It is comparatively
easy to learn to read the New Testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
[in Greek], and this is the chief utility of the
study.” Bible study formed an important feature
of the work of Class V, for concerning its work we
read: “A Bible Manual, also, called the Gate of
the Sanctuary, is to be placed in the pupils’ hands.
This is to contain the whole of Scripture history in
the words of the Bible, but so digested that it may
be read in one year.”</p>

<p>Class VII was theological; and the reader will
readily note the difference between the course of
instruction marked out for it by Comenius, and
that suggested by Professor Hoffman for theological
students in the twentieth century. “Inscription
over the door: ‘Let no one enter who is
irreligious.’ ... The class book should be a work
dealing with the last stage of wisdom on earth,
that is to say, the communion of souls with God.
Universal history should be studied, and in particular
the history of the church for whose sake the
world exists.... The future minister must learn
how to address a congregation, and should be
taught the laws of sacred oratory.”</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that Comenius was a
bishop of the Moravian Brethren, a denomination
noted for its extensive missionary work, its missions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
dotting the earth. Their activity in church work
can readily be accounted for by their system of
education. Any Protestant church which wishes
to survive, and desires the spread of its principles,
must see that its children are educated spiritually
as well as mentally and physically.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
education
emphasizes
practical</div>

<p>We are now brought to consider another
very important phase of education,—the
relation of mental to physical training.
False systems have ever exalted
the former to the neglect of the latter. Christ
combined the two, and educators from the seventeenth
century on have presented correct views on
the subject.</p>

<p>Locke begins his “Thoughts on Education” with
these words: “A sound mind in a sound body is a
short but full description of a happy state in this
world.” “The attainment of this happy condition,”
observes Painter, “is the end of education....
In his [Locke’s] mind, the function of education
was to form noble men well equipped for the
duties of practical life.”<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A pure soul in a sound body should precede
study of mere facts.</span> Locke’s ideas of education
are thus described by Quick: “His aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
was to give a boy a robust mind in a robust body.
His body was to endure hardness, his reason was
to teach him self-denial. But this result was to
be brought about by leading, not driving him. He
was to be trained, not for the university, but
for the world. Good principles, good manners,
and discretion were to be cared for first of all;
intelligence and intellectual activity next; and
actual knowledge last of all.... The prevalent
drill in the grammar of the classical languages
was to be abandoned, and the mother-tongue
was to be carefully studied.... In everything
the part the pupil was to play in life was steadily
to be kept in view.”</p>

<p>And yet to-day, when the editor of one of our
magazines proposed that our university students
discuss the question, “What order of studies is
best suited to fit the average man for his duties
in the world of to-day?” or, “What is the relative
importance of the various branches of education
in fitting a man to secure his own happiness and
rendering him a useful citizen and neighbor?” the
president of Yale University replied: “Some of
the men hesitate to give the official sanction of
the university to a debate on short notice on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
questions of which most of the contestants know
very little. Why should not our university students
know and choose the practical studies? If
they do not know them, why not?”<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Manual
training
and mathematics</div>

<p>There are educators, however, who are
willing to break away from the conservatism
of the past, and who advocate
a change of methods in the elementary
schools. Such are the thoughts presented by the
superintendent of public instruction in the State
of Michigan, in a manual issued in May, 1900.
There is sound sense in the following paragraphs,
which will appeal to all who consider the needs
of a child’s mind. He says:—</p>

<p>“It is the duty of the schools to produce parallel
growths of all the faculties, leaving the pupil
free to swing out into the realm of choice with no
distorted tastes or shortened powers. The training
of the hand ministers to this parallel development.</p>

<p>“We remember when the sciences were taught
wholly from the text. Later, the principles of
Pestalozzi entered the class room, and we stood
open-eyed and open-minded, as the truths of
science were demonstrated with the proper apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
in the hands of the teacher. But to-day
Froebel’s idea has taken possession, and the pupil
performs the experiment. It is his hand that
creates the conditions; it is his eye that watches
the changes, his hand that notes them. Science
teaching has thus adopted the manual training
idea; and such are the results that Latin, Greek,
and mathematics are no longer considered as the
only intellective subjects for college training.</p>

<p>“What the manual training idea has done for
science teaching, it will do for mathematics and
other kindred subjects. The dissatisfaction among
professional and business men regarding the teaching
of practical things in our schools is wide-spread.
This is especially true regarding arithmetic,
penmanship, spelling, and language. Anyone
who doubts this needs but to enter the business
places of his own city and make inquiry.
There is a well-grounded feeling that in the mastery
of arithmetic is a discipline closely allied to
that needed in the activities of life; and when a
father discovers that his child of sixteen or seventeen
years has no idea of practical business questions
and little skill in analytical processes, he
justly charges the school with inefficiency. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
difficulty, however, is that the pupil has had no
opportunity to sense arithmetic. To him measurements
and values are indefinite ideas. He commits
facts to memory, and blindly tries to work
out problems. If his memory and imagination
are good, he stands well, and receives a high
mark. But still the work is vague; it does not
touch his life or experience; it has no meaning.
Put that pupil into a manual-training school,—the
boy in the shop, the girl in the kitchen [practical
experience has demonstrated that the girl has a
place in the shop also],—and at once mathematical
facts become distinct ideas.</p>

<p>“Step into the shop of a manual-training
school [or step into the well-ordered kitchen], and
observe the boy with a project before him. What
are the steps through which his mind must bring
him to the final perfection of the work.</p>

<p>“First, he must give the project careful study.</p>

<p>“Second, he must design it and make a drawing
of it. This at once puts mathematics into his
hand as well as his head. He must use square,
compass, try-square, and pencil. Exact measurements
must be made, divisions and subdivisions
calculated, lines carefully drawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>“Third, he must select material of proper dimensions
and fiber, and then must reflect how to
apply it to the draught made so that there is
no waste.</p>

<p>“Fourth, he must plane and saw to the line,
correct and fit; in short, must create the project
that has had existence in his mind and upon paper
only. Then it is that his arithmetic begins to
throb with life, his judgment to command, and his
ethical sense to unfold.”</p>

<p>This is the testimony of teachers who have
made a practical application of arithmetic and
geometry in the carpenter shop. Children twelve
and fourteen years of age solve problems in proportion,
in square root, in measurements, and in
denominate numbers, which baffle the skill of the
ordinary high-school graduate. This, too, is a
part of Christian education. Doubtless Christ himself
gained most of his mathematical knowledge
at the carpenter’s bench.</p>

<p>“The most practical education,” says Hiram
Corson “(but this, so-considered, pre-eminently
practical age does not seem to know it), is the
education of the spiritual man; for it is this, and
not the education of the intellectual man, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
is, must be (or Christianity has made a great mistake),
the basis of individual character, and to
individual character ... humanity owes its sustainment.”
The proper combination, then, of
religious training and practical hand work in teaching
mathematics or language will develop stability
of character, and this is the end and aim of Christian
education.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carpentry
not the
only practical
educator</div>

<p>There are, however, in this twentieth
century, various other ways of rendering
education practical; and since these
ways are a factor in the Christian training
of youth, they should receive attention.
God made no mistake when he gave to
Adam the work of tilling the soil. Since the days
of Eden, those men who have shunned the cities,
and chosen instead to dwell in rural districts, have,
as a rule, come closest to the heart of the Creator.
The true way to study the sciences is to come in
touch with Nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ
chose the
country</div>

<p>For this, also, we have the example of
Christ. “In training His disciples, Jesus
chose to withdraw from the confusion of
the city, to the quiet of the fields and
hills, as more in harmony with the lessons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
self-abnegation He desired to teach them. And
during His ministry He loved to gather the people
about Him under the blue heavens, on some grassy
hillside, or on the beach beside the lake. Here,
surrounded by the works of His own creation, He
could turn the thoughts of His hearers from the
artificial to the natural. In the growth and development
of nature were revealed the principles
of His kingdom. As men should lift up their eyes
to the hills of God, and behold the wonderful
works of His hands, they could learn the precious
lessons of divine truth. Christ’s teaching would
be repeated to them in the things of nature....
The things of nature take up the parables of our
Lord, and repeat His counsels.”</p>

<p>The teacher who has a desire to ennoble the
character of his pupils will seek a place where
Nature in her silent language gives lessons which
no human tongue can utter. Parents who desire
the best good of their sons and daughters, will,
when the light of Christian education dawns upon
their minds, hasten into the country, that the
youthful minds over which they are keeping guard
may be influenced by the natural rather than by
the artificial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
the farm in
education</div>

<p>It is not surprising that the best educators
who have opened their minds to
truth have taught that cultivation of the
soil, with the training of the eye and the
hand in the shop, should accompany mental discipline.
Prof. James R. Buchanan, says: “Blessed
is the <i>farmer’s boy</i>.... The industrial feature,
not limited to handicraft, but embracing all forms
of useful exertion, <i>is the essential basis of a true
education</i>; as it insures, if rightly conducted, a
worthy character, a healthy constitution, a solid
intellect, and a capacity for practical success; for it
gives vigor to the entire brain, and a far better
invigorating mental discipline than can ever be
obtained from text-books. The boy who has constructed
a wagon, or a bureau, or <i>raised a small
crop</i>, as instructed, has more independence of mind
and originality than the one who has only studied
text-books. The boys of Lancaster, Ohio, who
gave half their time to useful industry, made better
progress in school studies than the common school
pupils who had their whole time for study, and at
the same time presented a model of conduct in all
respects unequaled in any non-working school in
this country.”<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Close adherence to the text-book is the papal
method of teaching, and is a necessary accompaniment
of prescribed courses, while the humanistic
tendency is well developed. Christian schools,
because of the truths they advocate, are forced to
depart from the established order in the educational
world, and their education is rendered practical by
joining <i>the farm and the school</i>.</p>

<p>This method of teaching is already followed in
some places, showing that that system so often
designated Christian education is not a thing of
recent birth, neither is it the product of some
man’s mind. Its principles have been made known
from time to time, and these principles have been
followed more or less carefully in all periods of the
world’s history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">School
Gardens
of Modern
Europe</div>

<p>That the combining of soil-cultivation
and study is a practical thing, and not
a mere theory, is attested by the
words of United States Consul-General
John Karel, who reports as follows concerning
“School Gardens in Russia:” “In a good many
countries of western Europe, especially in Germany,
Austria, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and
partly in Sweden, the public village schools have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
sections of land allotted to them, which are either
devoted to the use of the teachers, who take the
profits therefrom, or serve for the establishment
of school gardens. School gardens in western
Europe bear, in a certain measure, a scientific
character. Children are made to carry out in
them practically what they learn theoretically.</p>

<div class="sidenote">School
gardens in
Russia</div>

<p>“In Russia ... it was well known that
the land owners and peasants were in
great need of instruction in farming; consequently
schools of all kinds were established
by the ministry of agriculture throughout the
country.... For the development of the gardening
industry, schools were founded first in Penza,
in Bessarabia, ... and in 1869 a school of gardening
and viticulture was found at Nikitsk. The
work of the Nikitsk school was divided as follows:
During the winter semester there were three hours
of lessons per day and four and one-half hours of
practical study in the garden, vineyard, and in the
cellar. During the summer semester the lessons
in class lasted only one hour, or sometimes two
hours, but the practical studies occupied daily six
or even eight hours.”<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Teachers in these schools are enabled to support
themselves at least partially from the sale of fruits,
berries, vegetables, honey, etc., but this was not
the chief inducement in starting school gardens.
The writer last quoted continues: “The desire to
add something to the low salaries of the village
school teachers, and, on the other hand, to acquaint
as much as possible, not only children, but also
grown-up people, with gardening, sericulture, and
apiculture, has caused an increase during the last
ten years, in the number of school gardens, apiaries,
and silkworm hatcheries. In 1892 there
were about two thousand school gardens in Russia.
At the present time [1897] there are 7,521, with
532 apiaries, and 372 silkworm hatcheries.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mescherski, who is chief of one of the
departments of agriculture, and one of the principal
advocates of school gardens in Russia, has
stated the object of school gardens and their significance
as follows: “School gardens ... are of
importance on the following grounds. (1) Hygienic,
as being a place for physical labor in the
open air, so necessary for the teacher and pupils....
(2) Scientific educational, as acquainting
children with the life of useful plants, developing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
their minds by the study of nature, and promoting
in the rising generation a regard for labor and a
more moral and æsthetic sentiment concerning
trees. (3) General economical ... and (4) personal
economical,” which refers to the support of
the teacher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christians
should
encourage
rural life</div>

<p>If the Russian government, on the liberation
of its serfs and its crown peasants,
found it so greatly to its advantage to
establish school gardens, of what lasting
benefit would they be to Christians! Protestants,
instead of crowding into the cities where the
laboring man is subject to the trades unions,
trusts, and monopolies, should seek for themselves
a few acres of land, and should see that schools
are established for the education of their children
where the mechanical text-book grind is replaced
by the study of God’s will as revealed in His Word
and works. Nature studies thus conducted, instead
of developing doubt, will strengthen the faith of
the pupil, and the students from such schools will
be fitted for citizenship not only in the governments
of earth but in the Kingdom of God. This
also is a part of the system of instruction known as
Christian education.</p>

<h2 id="XVII">XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">CHRISTIAN EDUCATION (Continued)</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Education
defined by
Pestalozzi</div>

<p>The nineteenth century has not been
lacking in minds which have grasped,
at least in part, the principles of Christian
education. Thus writes Pestalozzi:
“Sound education stands before me symbolized
by a tree planted near fertilizing waters....
In the newborn child are hidden those faculties
which are to unfold during life. The individual and
separate organs of his being form themselves
gradually into an harmonic whole, and <i>build up
humanity in the image of God</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>With this agrees Milton’s definition of education.
“The end, then, of learning,” he says, “is to repair
the ruins of our first parents by regaining to know
God aright, and out of that knowledge to love
Him, to imitate Him, to be like Him, as we may
the nearest by possessing our souls of true virtue,
<i>which being united to the heavenly grace of faith</i>,
makes up the highest perfection.” This is similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
to the definition given by the author of “Christian
Education,” that “the true object of education
is to restore the image of God in the soul.”</p>

<p>Christian education, then, is a spiritual education.
In this sense the words of Pestalozzi, at
the burial of his wife, are pathetic but weighty
with significance. Turning to the coffin, he said
tenderly: “We were shunned and despised by all;
sickness and poverty bowed us down; and we ate
dry bread with tears. What was it in those days
of severe trial gave you and me strength to persevere
and not lose hope?” Laying a copy of
God’s Word on her breast, he continued: “From
this source you and I drew courage and strength
and peace.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Advocates of Christian education may to-day
encounter the same sort of rebuff from the world;
but God’s Word stands as guide, expressing the
principles to be followed by the educator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bible
as an
educator</div>

<p>Charles W. Dabney, Jr., president of
the University of Tennessee, in an address
gave utterance to these words.
“The Bible is the best text-book of
education, as of many other sciences. In it we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
read where Paul tells Timothy, his ‘dearly beloved
son in the faith,’ that ‘all scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness that the man of God may be perfect,
thoroughly furnished unto all good works.’ Nowhere
in literature or philosophy is there a better
or clearer expression of the true purpose of education
than this. The object of education is not
pleasure, or comfort, or gain, though all these may
and should result from it. The one true purpose
in education is to prepare the man for ‘good works.’
It is a noble thing to develop a perfect soul, to
thoroughly furnish a body, mind, and heart....
Character building, conscience forming, then, is
the main object of education. The teacher dare
not neglect character, nor the college to provide
for its development. We must always and everywhere,
in every course and scheme of study, provide
those methods and agencies which shall
develop the character of the pupil along with his
other powers. How, then, shall we develop character
in our pupils? What are the methods and the
agencies for doing this? This is the crucial question
of this age, as of every age. To this question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
all the ages give but one answer, and that is <i>Christianity</i>.
The world has had many teachers of
science, art, and philosophy, but only one teacher
of righteousness, and He was Jesus Christ, the
Son of God.”</p>

<p>The many teachers of science, art, and philosophy,
have, by their systems of education, led
men away from the knowledge of God, the wisdom
which is eternal life. If the education of
Christ is to be accepted, as suggested by Professor
Dabney, His word, the Bible, must be
recognized as the Book of books, the guide in all
investigation, the interpreter of all phenomena.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian
schools
needed</div>

<p>Much is said concerning the moral education
which every child should receive.
Parents realize that the boy or girl who
grows to maturity with only a physical
or intellectual education is either a pugilist or a fit
subject for the penitentiary, and hence they insist
that the spiritual nature should receive some attention.
But where is this spiritual education to be
obtained? State schools have no right to give such
training; indeed, they can not do it. True, they
have attempted it, but it is a miserable failure.
Protestants should no longer make the demand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
The time has come for them to see that they
should establish schools, whose object it is to develop
character. These schools should receive
support independent of the state; they should be
free to follow methods entirely different from the
formalism of the papal system; their course of instruction
should meet the individual needs of the
pupils, and be of a character which will develop
Christians. To accomplish such results, the Word
of God must be taken from the dust, and placed in
the curriculum, not as a mere reference book of
Jewish antiquities, but, as it is in deed and in truth,
the light whose rays encircle the world. “The
Holy Scriptures must be the Alpha and Omega of
Christian schools,” wrote Comenius. Christ must
be the teacher.</p>

<p>The men thus far quoted have followed the light
which shone upon their pathway. To-day we may
gather the scattered gems of truth left by them;
but, better far, we may go direct to the Word
itself, and the Spirit of truth will guide into the
paths of Christian education. As taught by Froebel,
“The spiritual and physical development do
not go on separately in childhood, but the two are
closely bound up with each other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Man’s
threefold
nature</div>

<p>The human being has a threefold nature,—the
physical, the mental, and the spiritual;
and Christian education so develops
these that they sustain the proper
relation one to another. The spiritual nature was
the controlling power in the man made in God’s
image. In the degeneration of the race, he lost
his spiritual insight, and passed first to the intellectual
plane, then to the physical. This is seen in
the history before the flood. Eden life was a spiritual
existence; Adam’s life after the fall was less
spiritual, and gradually his descendants came to
live on the mental plane. There were master
minds in the antediluvian world. Men had no
need of books, so strong was the memory and so
keen the insight. Through further disobedience,
through an education which strengthened reason
rather than faith, men sank to the physical plane
instead of rising to the spiritual, until in due time
the earth was destroyed by water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
since the
time of
Christ</div>

<p>The same planes of existence are distinguishable
in all ages since the flood, but
Christ alone rose to the purely spiritual
level. Israel as a nation might have so
lived had true educational methods been followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Israel falling, the offer was made to the Christian
church. Age by age that body has refused to live
a spiritual life, or, accepting the proffered gift, has
attempted to rise without complying with the necessary
conditions,—absolute faith in God’s Word
and strict compliance with his commands. The
Reformation again turned men’s eyes toward a
spiritual education, and American Protestants had
the best opportunity ever offered man to return to
the original design of the Creator. Failure is again
the verdict of the recording angel. Time hastens
on, and the last gospel message is going to the
world; but before <i>a people can be prepared for the
setting up of Christ’s kingdom, they must be educated
according to the principles of Christian education</i>,
for this is <i>the foundation</i> of all government
as well as of all religion.</p>

<p>What is Christian education? Since its object is
the training of a human being for life eternal, and
that existence is a spiritual life, the spiritual must
be the predominating feature of the education.
When the spiritual leads, the intellectual and
physical take their proper positions. The inner or
spiritual man feeds only upon truth, absolute truth;
not theory nor speculation, but truth. “Thy word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
is truth.” <i>The Word of God must then be the
basis</i> of all Christian education, the science of salvation
the central theme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The test</div>

<p>Since God reveals his character in two
ways, in his Word and in his works,
the Bible must be the first book in Christian
education, and the book of nature next. Many
educators have seen the value of the book of nature,
and to-day nature-study forms a large part
of the course of instruction in all grades of schools.
It may be asked, Is not this, then, Christian education?
We reply, Does it restore in men the
image of God? If so, it passes the test. But it
can not be said to do this, and therefore it falls
short. Wherein, then, lies the difficulty in modern
nature-teaching, or the sciences in general?
Read some of our modern text-books in science.
They readily reveal the answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomy
as
taught denies
the
Bible</div>

<p>Young’s General Astronomy reads:
“Section 908. Origin of the Nebular
Hypothesis.—Now this [the present
condition] is evidently a good arrangement
for a planetary system, and
therefore <i>some have inferred</i> that the Deity made
it so, <i>perfect from the first</i>. But to one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
considers the way in which other perfect works
of nature usually come to perfection—their processes
of growth and development—<i>this explanation
seems improbable. It appears far more
likely that the planetary system grew than that
it was built outright</i>.... In its main idea that
the solar system once existed as a nebulous mass,
and has reached its present state as the result
of a series of purely physical processes, it seems
certain to prove correct, and <i>it forms the foundation
of all the current speculations upon the
subject</i>.</p>

<p>“Section 909. La Place’s Theory.—(<i>a</i>) He
supposed that at some past time, which may be
taken as a starting point of our system’s history,
... the matter collected in the sun and planets
was in the form of a nebula. (<i>b</i>) This nebula
was a cloud of intensely heated gas, perhaps
hotter, <i>as he supposed</i>, than the sun is now. (<i>c</i>)
This nebula, <i>under the action of its own gravitation</i>,
assumed an approximately globular form,
with a rotation around its axis,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>The student must decide whether he will base
his study of the heavens and the earth—the study
of astronomy, geography, and geology, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
zoology, and botany indirectly—on this hypothesis,
which, we are told, “forms the foundation
of all current speculations upon the subject;” or
whether he will turn from these <i>reasonable explanations</i>
for the existence of things, and take the
plain Word of truth, which says, “By the Word
of the Lord were the heavens made;” “He spake
and it was; he commanded and it stood fast,”
together with the explanation as given in Genesis
and elsewhere in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Faith and finite reason face each other; the
education of the world takes reason; Christian
education is based upon faith in God’s Word.
Which will develop character? <i>Why is it that
modern science-study does not lead to God?</i>—<span class="smcap">In
the evolutionary teaching of the nebular
hypothesis you have one answer.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution
as taught
in zoology</div>

<p>Picking up an ordinary text-book in zoology,
we read: “The earliest member
of the <i>series directly leading up to the
horse</i> was eohippus, an older eocene
form about as large as a fox, which had four well-developed
toes and the rudiments of a fifth on
each forefoot, and three toes behind. In later
eocene beds appeared an animal of similar size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
but with only four toes in front and three behind.
In newer beds, i.e., lower miocene, are found
the remains of mesohippus, which was as large
as a sheep and had three toes and the splint of
another in each forefoot.... The succeeding
forms were still more horse-like.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Next they
find a donkey-like animal, and later “a true equus,
as large as the existing horse, appears just above
the horizon, and the series is complete.”<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>If the horse tribe has evolved from a fox-like
animal, it is little wonder that men trace their
origin to the monkey tribe; but those who wish
God’s character, take by faith the statement that
“in the image of God created He him.”</p>

<p>Such theories form the basis for the generally
adopted classification of the entire vegetable and
animal worlds. Christian education demands new
text-books, based upon the truths of God’s Word.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dana on
origin of
species</div>

<p>From Dana, the recognized authority on
geology, the following sentences are
quoted: “Life commenced among plants,
in <i>seaweeds</i>; and it ended in <i>palms</i>,
<i>oaks</i>, <i>elms</i>, the <i>orange</i>, <i>rose</i>, etc. It commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
among animals in <i>lingulæ</i> (mollusks standing on a
stem like a plant), <i>crinoids</i>, <i>worms</i>, and <i>trilobites</i>,
and probably earlier in the simple systemless protozoans;
it ended in <i>man</i>.” For this development,
he says, “Time is long.”</p>

<p>In a paragraph on “Progress Always the Gradual
Unfolding of a System,” are the words:
“There were higher and lower species appearing
through <i>all the ages</i>, but the successive populations
were still, in their general range, of higher and
higher grade; and thus the progress was ever upward.
The type or plan of vegetation, and the
four grand types or plans of animal life, the radiate,
molluscan, articulate, and vertebrate, were
each displayed under multitudes of tribes and
species, <i>rising in rank with the progress of time</i>....
Its progress should be, <i>as zoological history
attests, a development, an unfolding, an evolution</i>.”</p>

<p>In the study of this evolution in animal life,
he says, “The progress in the system of life is a
progress in cephalization,” and he gives several
illustrations, as the passage from tadpole to frog;
from lobster to crab, from worm to insect, etc.
Such teachers speak always of the evolution from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the lower to the higher forms of life, but leave
retrogression entirely out of their reckoning.</p>

<p>To those who offer the Sacred Record in opposition
to his so-called geological proofs, Dana says:
“The Biblical student finds, in the first chapter of
Genesis, positive statement with regard to the
creation of living beings. But these statements
are often misunderstood; for they really leave the
question as to the operation of natural causes for
the most part an open one,—as asserted by
Augustine, among the Fathers of the church and
by some Biblical interpreters of the present day....
In view of the whole subject, the following
appears to be the conclusions most likely to be sustained
by further research: The evolution of the
system of life went forward <i>through derivation of
species from species, according to usual methods,
not yet clearly understood, <span class="smcap">and with few occasions
for supernatural intervention</span></i>,” etc.</p>

<p>Thus have the truths in God’s great lesson book
of nature been misinterpreted. It was a step in
the right direction when the mechanical drill of the
classics was dropped, and nature studies substituted;
but God’s Word must take its place as the
interpreter of nature and natural phenomena, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the theory of evolution is the natural result, and
this will form no part of Christian education.</p>

<p>Protestant parents, are your children learning
to see in the visible things about them the emblems
of the invisible, even the eternal power and
godhead? If not, why do you not put them where
they will? This is their salvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Underlying
principles
neglected</div>

<p>The exaltation of detail and the belittling
of principles is a common error in
educational systems. This is seen in all
departments of learning. Not only is it
exemplified in the exaltation of the mental and the
physical above the spiritual, but the same method
is employed in the detail work of the class room.
This is in essence papal education. Christian
education requires teachers to reverse the order
throughout the whole course of instruction.</p>

<p>To illustrate the thought: There are a few fundamental
principles which govern the universe.
Such is the statement of the truth, “The love of
Christ constraineth us,” which contains within it
the whole explanation of the force of gravity,
adhesion, cohesion, molecular attraction, chemical
affinity, human love, and the law of sex, and is
therefore illustrated in physics, chemistry, mineralogy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
biology,—in fact, in all the sciences.
Again the second great commandment, “Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,” is the statement
of a principle which underlies all history,
civil government, and political and social science.
If followed, it will solve all international difficulties,
as well as prevent personal animosity; it will
blot out the evils of society, breaking down the
barrier between poverty and riches; trusts would
never exist, trades unions would be unnecessary,
and monopolies unknown, if the one law of
Jehovah were only learned. Of how much greater
value, then, is the study of such principles than all
the theories which may be proposed by men for
international arbitration, or all the laws which
may be passed in legislative halls concerning
the equal rights of men and the proper means
of governing States, Territories, or acquired possessions.</p>

<p>But this is Christian education, and lessons
such as this are learned only when the truth is
written on the heart by the pen of the Spirit. It
is thus that a spiritual education, the higher birth
of which the Saviour spoke, rises above the education
of the world as far as heaven is above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
earth. When these and kindred principles are
made the central thought, all the facts which the
pupil may be able to learn in a lifetime, will but
serve to impress the truth more firmly on his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deductions
from facts
not always
correct</div>

<p>All the facts which it is possible for man
to gather in a lifetime, added to all that
are gathered by generation after generation,
are but illustrations of a few principles.
Modern teaching deals almost wholly with
facts; it requires children, from the time they enter
school until they are graduated, to heap together
facts. Process is the great theme in mathematics;
facts, facts, facts, are the things sought for in the
whole realm of natural science. History is but the
study of still more facts, and where generalizations
or classifications are made, they are theories formulated
from the facts gathered. But man is
never able to collect all the facts; he is never sure
that his conclusions have reached absolute truth.
The truth of the matter is, the classifications thus
formed are only partially correct, and the discovery
of a few more facts overthrows the finespun theories
of the best of scientists. It is thus constantly
in astronomy, in botany, in zoology, and in biology.
Because of new discoveries, the physician of yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
is wholly wrong in the eyes of the physician
of to-day. To-morrow the bright light of to-day
will be superseded by some other luminary. This
is the result of inductive reasoning based on sense
perception.</p>

<p>This thought is well expressed by Hinsdale, who
says: “We observe and register phenomena, classify
facts, deduce conclusions and laws, and build
up systems; but in science and philosophy we
return to the subject again and again; we seek to
verify our facts and test our conclusions, and when
we have finished, we are not sure, save in a limited
sphere, of our results. Some of the best-known
sciences have been largely reorganized within the
last few years. We have the ‘new chemistry,’
the ‘new astronomy,’ the ‘new political economy,’
and even the ‘new mathematics.’ Particularly in
the field of human conduct, where man’s will is the
governing faculty, we are often uncertain of our
way and sometimes are wholly lost.”<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sense
perception
often
incorrect</div>

<p>The shifting foundation upon which such
knowledge rests is well illustrated by the
tests which the human being is able to
make with the organs of sense. Water
of 98° is hot to the hand that has been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
to a temperature of 45°, but cool to the hand which
is just taken from water of 112°. An orange is
sweet to the man who has been eating a stronger
acid, but sour to the palate accustomed to sugar.
The eye which has been used in a dimly lighted
room is dazzled by the noonday glare, and judging
of the size of a star by sight we would not conceive
it to be a sun. The knowledge gained by the
senses is only partially true,—it is not absolute
truth; and the scientific theories propounded by
minds which have reasoned from these inaccurate
data can not fail to fall short of absolute truth. It
may be <i>knowledge</i>; it is not <i>wisdom</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faith is
substance,
not theory</div>

<p>Christian education approaches nature
from the opposite direction. With a
mind open to receive truth, it grasps <i>by
faith</i> the statement of a universal principle.
The spiritual law is the thing sought, and the
corresponding physical law is compared with it.
Once found, every fact which is learned, every
observation made, but shows more clearly the
working of that law in the spiritual world. For
such teaching, faith is an indispensable attribute.
Experiment is not discouraged, but strongly encouraged;
reason is not laid aside, but the mind is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
called upon to reason on subjects grander and
nobler than any deductions which can possibly
result from the opposite manner of approaching
truth.</p>

<p>This is the ideal in Christian education, the point
toward which the Christian teacher is leading his
pupils. In case of unbelief, or in dealing with the
heathen, the mind must first be approached
through the avenues of the senses, until the Spirit
of God arouses the inner eye of faith. This is
merely preliminary, and should not long continue.
Children are not given credit for having the faith
they really do possess, and are therefore held to
the inductive method by educators long after their
minds and hearts are capable of grasping truth,
and when it would be found that the deductive
method would produce a much more rapid growth
of mental and spiritual power than is now seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Christian
teacher</div>

<p>This suggests the qualifications necessary
on the part of a teacher. Remembering
that this education is of a spiritual nature,
the teacher himself must be connected
with truth by an unwavering faith.</p>

<p>When Nicodemus, the representative of higher
education in the schools of Jerusalem, interviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Christ, the new Teacher who had appeared in their
midst, and whose teaching was attended by a power
unknown to the educators of the day, the learned
man said, “Rabbi, we know Thou art a teacher
sent of God.” “But how can these things be?”
The heavenly Teacher outlined to him the secrets
of His educational system, telling Nicodemus that
it was not based on sight, but on faith; that the
spiritual was first, and, when so made, the rest
would follow. Then came the query, “How can
it be?” To which Christ replied, “If I told
you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?” “Art
thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these
things?”</p>

<p>In view of these thoughts, it is not strange that
the study of the sciences in a Christian school will
differ widely from the course offered in the same
department of learning in an institution where the
object of education is wholly different.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physiology
the central
science</div>

<p>Discarding the evolutionary theory which
pervades the teaching of all institutions
where education is not wholly based on
the Word of God, man, created in the
image of God, is recognized as the highest manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
of creative power. The life of God is
the first study; that <i>life</i>, as manifested in man, is
the next, and physiology takes its place as the center
of all science-study. This is a study of life in
all its manifestations, beginning with the spiritual,
and extending to the mental and physical. Here,
as elsewhere, the laws which govern the spiritual
nature have their types in the other two natures;
and when once the central truth of <i>life</i>, an abundance
of life, is grasped, the study of physiology
becomes not the study of dead forms, mere facts,
but a soul-study, which includes the home of the
inner man and all the machinery which the soul
manipulates. Thus considered, from this center
(physiology) extend rays, like the spokes of a
wheel, each representing another science, until
within that broad circle represented by these radii,
are included all the physical as well as all the metaphysical
sciences.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this mode of correlating the
sciences cures at once the mistake of the age,—the
cramming system,—which results from a
neglect of manual training and from the study of
a multiplicity of books, crowded with facts which
must be stored in the mind of the student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Correlation
of sciences</div>

<p>By placing physiology as the center of
the circle, and correlating therewith all
other sciences, another advantage arises,
for that circle includes within itself the languages
and mathematics. These latter are but helps
in the study of the thought-bearing subjects,—the
Bible and the sciences,—and instead of
being studied as primary subjects, should be <i>used
as a means to an end</i>. Reading, writing, spelling,
grammar, rhetoric, and literature, and mathematics,
from arithmetic to general geometry and calculus,
are but means of expressing truths gained in the
study of the revealed Word and the book of nature.
The simplicity of the system will appeal to the
mind of any educator, for it is a plan long sought
for. The one thing lacking among those who have
experimented with such methods has been the central
subject, God’s Word. Having truth as the basis
for the correlation, the problem, so far as methods
are concerned, is practically solved.</p>

<p>The great and pressing need is for teachers who
can execute the plan. No narrow mind will be
equal to the task. Again, as a system of true education
is approached, is seen the exalted position to
which those who teach are called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The basis
of every
educational
effort</div>

<p>Before passing the subject of physiology
it is well to consider the meaning of the
expression that this subject “<i>should be
the basis of every educational effort</i>.”
Text-book study of physiology, it is
clear, can not cover this requirement. The fact is
that <i>book-study</i> is but a small part of Christian
education. True education is life, and he who
learns much must live much. The food eaten, the
manner of clothing the body, the study, exercise,
mental habits, physical habits, manual training, in
fact, every phase of life is a part of the study of
physiology and hygiene, and these subjects must
one and all receive due consideration by the
Christian educator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manual
training
and education</div>

<p>Manual training is becoming popular in
many of our city schools, but the work
offered in a Christian school will differ
from that of the worldly school in this,—the
latter is training the hand or the eye only, the
former is building character by giving a trade that
enables the student to be self-supporting and independent.
In that the aims are different, the
methods must differ, although the matter taught
may in many cases be identical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Healthful
diet and
dress</div>

<p>Healthful living is receiving attention in
many schools. The Christian school,
while teaching the same subject, will
have as its object a preparation for
eternal life. The subject, taught without faith, will
bring only increased physical and mental activity.
The spiritual nature can be reached alone by that
education which is based on faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of
books</div>

<p>Simply a casual investigation of the
subject of Christian education reveals
the need of books for the guidance of
teachers who undertake to direct the growth of the
child. With proper study-books, based upon the
eternal principles of truth revealed in the Scriptures,
the work which is now in its infancy would
make much more rapid and substantial progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The home
school</div>

<p>Parents who sense the responsibility
resting upon them in the rearing of
children for the kingdom of heaven are
anxious to know when and where the principles of
Christian education can be carried out. The
beauty of the system is nowhere more vividly portrayed
than in the recognition which it gives to the
<i>home</i> and the <i>duty of parents</i> toward their children
in the matter of education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the fact that much is said relative to
the importance of educating for the state, the words
of Herbert Spencer give a clear idea of the home
as the center of the true system. He says: “As
the family comes before the state in order of time—as
the bringing up of children is possible before
the state exists, or when it has ceased to be,
whereas the state is rendered possible only by the
bringing up of children, it follows that the duties
of the parent demand closer attention than those of
the citizen.” The plan of Christian education
goes a little farther, and recognizing the earthly
family as a type of the heavenly, places the parents
in God’s place to the young children; hence the
home should be the only school and “the parents
should be the only teachers of their children until
they have reached eight or ten years of age.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lessons
for the
home
school</div>

<p>“The mother should find time to cultivate
in herself and in her children a love
for the beautiful buds and opening
flowers.... The only schoolroom for
children from eight to ten years of age should be
in the open air, amid the opening flowers and
nature’s beautiful scenery. And their only text-book
should be the treasures of nature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
church
school</div>

<p>With such a training, the first ten years
the child should develop a strong body
and a strong mind. He should then be
able to spend the next five or six years
under the instruction of a consecrated Christian
teacher in an elementary school, where teacher
and parents may co-operate. The threefold nature
must be developed so that when the age of manhood
or womanhood is reached, strength of character
has also been gained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
industrial
school</div>

<p>The youth should then continue his
mental culture in some industrial school,
located in the country, where there is
freedom from the evils of city life, and
where the rapidly developing physical nature can
be correctly guided into lines of practical duties
which will fit him for real life. In the meantime,
mental culture and spiritual training are continued,
for character is being formed for eternity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Training

Christian
workers</div>

<p>The young man or woman of twenty or
twenty-two should be prepared to select
a life-work, and the special training
needed can be received in a training
school, which in Christian education will be for
Christian workers. Such a school will be necessary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
for the education thus outlined, extending
from infancy over twenty years, can not fail to
develop a character which chooses <i>Christian work</i>
as the life occupation. A short training in a
higher institution, which in character is <i>a school
of the prophets</i>, should so round out the nature
already forming that the young person goes out
an ambassador for Christ, willing to be used in
any capacity by the Commander of the heavenly
host, whether it be on the farm, at the carpenter’s
bench, or in the pulpit; for his soul is knit to the
King of heaven, as was David’s to Jonathan’s.
Such a student is prepared for active service,
either on earth or in the kingdom of our God; for
he is one with the Father and his Son.</p>

<p>“Comenius divided the first twenty-four years
of life into four periods, to each of which he would
assign a special school, thus:—</p>

<p>“1. For infancy, the school should be the
mother’s knee.</p>

<p>“2. For childhood the school should be the
vernacular school.</p>

<p>“3. For boyhood, the Latin school or gymnasium.</p>

<p>“4. For youth, the university and travel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>“A mother should exist in every house, a vernacular
school in every hamlet and village, a gymnasium
in every city, and a university in every
kingdom or in every province.... The mother
and the vernacular school embrace all the young
of both sexes. The Latin school gives a more
thorough education to those who aspire higher
than the workshop; while the university trains up
the teachers and the learned men of the future,
that our churches, schools, and states may never
lack suitable leaders.”</p>

<p>In the system known as Christian education the
division is about the same, the years of student
life extending perhaps to thirty instead of twenty-four,
with this division: the first ten years are
spent in the home school; from ten to fifteen in
the church school; from fifteen to twenty in the
industrial school, and the years from twenty to
twenty-five or even thirty are devoted to study
and active work in the training school for workers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Should
Protestants
educate?</div>

<p>The time now is when those who are
true Protestants <i>will</i> demand Christian
education, and when no sacrifice will be
considered too great for the accomplishment
of that object. The prophecy of Zechariah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
recorded in the ninth chapter, gives the words of
God concerning the contest to take place near the
close of time between the sons of Greece and the
sons of Zion. “Turn you to the stronghold, ye
prisoners of hope; even to-day do I declare that
I will render double unto thee; when I have bent
Judah for Me, filled the bow with Ephraim, <span class="smcap">and
raised up thy sons</span>, O Zion, <span class="smcap">against thy sons,
O Greece</span>.”</p>

<p>Greece is recognized in the Scriptures as emblematic
of worldly wisdom,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> but by that wisdom the
world knew not God; in fact, by that wisdom the
world was led away from God. God will, then,
raise up the sons of Zion, the representatives of
His wisdom—the divine philosophy—against the
sons of Greece, or the students of the wisdom of
the world; and in the final conflict, when truth
wins, it will be evident that those who are numbered
with the victors have forsaken the wisdom
of Greece for the wisdom of God. It is not
theory, but the most solemn fact, that the preparation
for a life with God demands that we and
our children receive a far different education than
has been offered in the past. If we wish the
highest culture, if we long for soul development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
our education must be spiritual in nature; we must
leave the low, turbid waters of the valley for the
snow waters of Lebanon. This is Christian education.</p>

<p>Protestants to-day see their children slipping
from the fold. Every inducement in the way of
entertainments, form, ceremony, and oratory is
used to attract the youth to the church, but still
the world allures them. Ministers are beginning
to search for the reason, and are attributing it to
the character of the education now given in our
schools; in saying this, they strike at the root of
the trouble. Protestantism is dying; the form
of godliness, which denies the power thereof, is
spreading its dark mantle over the earth. It is in
vain that we point to stately edifices or noted
divines; if we can not recognize the difficulty, it
but proves that we are ourselves under the cloud,
and recovery is all but impossible.</p>

<p>We talk of the spread of Christianity; we give
of our means for the conversion of the heathen,
while our children perish within our very homes.
The spirit and power of Elias, which was to accompany
the preaching of the kingdom of Christ, was
“to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Cries the prophet Joel, “<i>Gather the children</i>, and
those that suck the breast.... Let the priests,
the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch
and the altar, and let them say, Spare Thy people,
O Lord, and give not Thine heritage [the children]
to reproach, that the heathen should rule over
them.”</p>

<p>Ministers, fathers, mothers, look to the welfare
of your children, or the cause of Protestantism
is lost in America. Take up your first, your all-important
duty, and give your children a Christian
education, and instead of a decline in church membership
as now reported, there will be an increase;
instead of formalism, there will be life. This will
be the means of bringing the heathen to your door,
and to a knowledge of the gospel.</p>

<p>“Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold;
all these gather themselves together, and come to
thee. As I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely
clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament,
and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth. For thy
waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy
destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason
of the inhabitants.... <i>The children which
thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
shall say again in thine ears, the place is too
strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.
Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath
begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children,
and am desolate?... Who hath brought up
these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where
had they been? Thus saith the Lord God, Behold!
I will lift up Mine hand to the Gentiles, and
set up My standard to the people; and they shall
bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters
shall be carried upon their shoulders. And kings
shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with
their faces toward the earth, and lick up the dust
of thy feet.... For I will contend with him that
contendeth with thee, <span class="smcap">and I will save thy
children</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>How will He save the children?—“<span class="smcap">All thy
children shall be taught of the Lord.</span>”
When will the Gentiles come bringing their
children to supply the places of those now
lost?—When Protestants can show to the Gentiles
that they have a system of education which
is free from the errors now so prevalent; when
they can teach the Gentiles the <span class="smcap">truth</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear;
break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that
didst not travail with child: for more are the
children of the desolate than the children of the
married wife, saith the Lord. Enlarge the place
of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains
of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy
cords, and strengthen thy stakes; for thou shalt
break forth on the right hand and on the left;
and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles.”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>When shall these things be? The same chapter
of Isaiah answers. When “all thy children shall
be taught of the Lord.” When Protestants educate
according to the principles of true Protestantism,
then will the words of the same prophet,
recorded in the sixtieth chapter, be fulfilled.
“Arise, be enlightened, for thy light cometh....
The Gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to
the brightness of thy rising.... Thy sons shall
come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed
at thy side.”<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Christ came, fulfilling in every particular the
prophecies quoted. “As thou hast sent Me into
the world, even so have I also sent them into the
world,” are the words of Christ to His church. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Christ was a teacher, so that church which does
the work which the Christian church <i>must</i> do, will
have a system of education, and its members will
be educators indeed.</p>

<p>Of Christ as a teacher it is written, “He raised
Himself above all others whom millions to-day
regard as their grandest teachers. Buddha, Confucius,
Mohammed, to say nothing of Greek and
Roman sages, are not worthy to be compared with
Christ.” Says Paroz: “Jesus Christ, in founding
a new religion, has laid the foundation of a new
education in the bosom of humanity.”</p>

<p>“In lowliness and humility,” writes Dr. Schaff,
“in the form of a servant as to the flesh, yet
effulgent with divine glory, the Saviour came
forth from a despised corner of the earth; destroyed
the power of evil in our nature; realized
in His spotless life, and in His sufferings, the
highest idea of virtue and piety, lifted the world
with His pierced hands out of its distress; reconciled
men to God, and gave a new direction to the whole
current of history.”</p>

<p>It is the education which He taught, which was
His very life even in the courts of heaven, which
Protestants are now entreated to accept. “To-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
if ye will hear His voice, harden not your
hearts.”</p>

<p>Where are the Protestants who are true to the
name? Where are the schools which will teach
the things of God? Where are the teachers who
forsake secular methods, as did the Reformers, to
become teachers for Christ?</p>

<p>Earth with its inhabitants is to the heart of God
the most precious part of the creation. As a
recreant child draws harder on the parent’s sympathy,
so the world, because of the sinfulness of
sin, has brought heaven and earth in touch. The
universe sees streaming from the throne rays of
light and love, pointing to the one spot in all
creation where sin abounds. They tell the story
of the cross. The perfect harmony which forms
the “music of the spheres,” which was marred
when man fell, will again pervade all space when
the plan of salvation is complete, and our earth
again joins in the great chorus of the sons of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Truth
revealed
in the
last days</div>

<p>For six thousand years creation has
groaned, waiting for our redemption.
The completion of the plan draws nigh,
and for the final struggle everything is
now assuming an intensity never before seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Principles of truth, for centuries hidden, or known
only in part, will again shine forth in their original
splendor. The wisdom of the ages will be manifest
in the closing era of the world’s history. True,
this wisdom will often appear but “foolishness” in
the eyes of those who oppose truth; but spiritual
things are spiritually discerned, and the Spirit of
the Holy One will once more brood over the whole
earth, taking up its abode in those hearts which
beat in unison with the strains of heaven. Christian
education binds earth to heaven. The wise
in heart will return to the God-given system
of education, choosing “the fountains of living
waters” instead of hewing “them out cisterns,
broken cisterns that can hold no water.”<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p class="center larger bold">The Desire of Ages</p>

<p class="center bold">By MRS. E. G. WHITE.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing that has such power to
lift the poor out of their poverty, the wretched out
of their misery, to make the burden-bearer forget
his burdens, the sick his sufferings, the sorrower
his grief, the downtrodden his degradation, as good
books. Particularly is this true of publications that
have the Bible for their foundation, and pre-eminently
among these is the book, “The Desire of
Ages.”</p>

<p>It is a friend to the friendless, joy to the joyless,
hope to the hopeless, a helper to the helpless, good
cheer and courage to the disheartened. It will
bring light into darkness, and sunshine into
shadow; it reveals the life and character of the Master
in a way that gives the reader a new glimpse of
our Father’s love in the gift of His only begotten
Son for the fallen race.</p>

<p>“The Desire of Ages” is a book for parents,
educators, teachers, and students. It is an invaluable
reference book, and should be in every home
and library.</p>

<p>It is printed on extra finished, supercalendered
book paper; contains 866 pages, 87 chapters, general
and Scriptural indexes, and appendix; is beautifully
illustrated, handsomely and substantially
bound. The various styles of binding and prices
bring the book within the reach of all.</p>

<p class="center bold clear"><i>THIS IS THE TITLE OF OUR NEW
HISTORY TEXT-BOOK.</i></p>

<p>“The Great Empires of Prophecy” is the <i>history</i> that
is foretold in the <i>prophecies</i> of the great empires
in the book of Daniel,—Babylon, Medo-Persia,
Grecia, Rome, and the ten divisions of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>More than eighty of the standard historians and authorities
on the history of the respective empires of the prophecy,
speak in the book in their own language; so that it is
fairly a cyclopedia of <i>history</i>, in fulfilment of the prophecies
of the book of Daniel.</p>

<p>Are you interested in the book of Daniel? You can not
afford to be without this book.</p>

<p>Every minister, every Bible worker, every student of the
book of Daniel, and every student of history, needs this
book. It contains 712 large pages, besides 22 full-page
maps, made especially for the book by the author, and
printed in from three to thirteen colors.</p>

<p>The book is issued in one style of binding, and the price
is only $2.00.</p>

<p class="center larger bold">GOOD FORM AND CHRISTIAN<br />
ETIQUETTE,</p>

<p class="center bold">By the Late Mrs. S. M. I. HENRY,<br />
Twenty-five years National Evangelist W. C. T. U.</p>

<p>In this little volume is expressed the ripened
thought of the author’s many years of experience in
Christian work, testing the grand principles of Good
Form and Christian Etiquette.</p>

<p>Polite manners are the first requisite to the entering
of good society.</p>

<p>“Good Form” is not a book of rules to be committed
to memory for any special occasion, but it contains
principles to be woven into the character and
daily life.</p>

<p>The book contains 150 pages, with portrait of the
author, and copious index of subjects. Bound in two
styles.</p>

<p class="center bold">Words of Commendation for “Good Form:”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Good Form and Christian Etiquette” is a sensible, well-written,
practical, and helpful book. It is based on the Christian
conception of life, and conforms to the best usages of
American Society.—<span class="smcap">J. H. Vincent.</span></p>

<p>I am much pleased with the little booklet “Good Form and
Christian Etiquette.” Its pages are replete with good advice
on subjects of everyday interest. Christian courtesy is one of
the most necessary qualifications of the Christian worker, and
I feel sure this latest of Mrs. Henry’s works will prove a timely
help to parents in bringing up their children; to our young
people in their associations with others; and in fact to everyone
who desires to so equip himself that his bearing shall have the
true dignity of Christian refinement.—<span class="smcap">Mrs. E. E. Kellogg</span>,
<i>Sec. Child Culture Circles, National W. C. T. U.</i></p>

<p>I have examined “Good Form” with great care and interest.
It is certainly a very practical contribution to the literature
on etiquette. Most books on this subject are too elaborate, and
have too much of the fashionable society air; but this one meets
the needs of common people, and I am sure they will thank
Mrs. Henry for this effort to help them in making life’s pathway
pleasant and easier.—<span class="smcap">Mary Wood-Allen, M. D.</span>,
<i>Supt. Purity Dept. World’s W. C. T. U.</i></p>
